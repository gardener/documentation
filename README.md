### Website (this repository)
The Repository https://github.com/gardener/website/ contains the generated
Landing page. All manual changes get lost.

### Documentation
https://github.com/gardener/documentation/ contains the real content of the 
Landing page. Add/Remove/Modify/ pages or content here

### Generator
https://github.com/gardener/website-generator contains the site generator *Hugo*
and all the layout and js stuff.



# Contribute
## Add a new page`

All content for your website will live inside the `content` directory. Each top-level folder in Hugo is considered a 
content section. For example, if your site has three main sections—blog, articles, and tutorials—you will have 
three directories at `./content/blog`, `./content/articles`, and `./content/tutorials`.

### Order of content
Normally, the top navigation of a Hugo site is ordered by a `weight` attribute in the front matter section of the `_index.md`
file. For this website, I decide to use the directory order and put a number in front of each directory. With this
method, the directory order is synchronized with the menu order. This is more convenient for a content developer 
to navigate between website and content.

### Kind of pages
This website supports three kind of pages
 - local
 - remote
 - repository
 
 
#### Local page
A `local` page is nothing special for hugo. A good example for a local page is the `./content/060-curated-links/_index.md`
file.

#### Remote Page
a `remote page` contains the front matter section with the reference to the remote `md` file.
Good example is `./content/020_getting_started/_index.md`

``` 

---
title: Getting Started
url: /about/
remote: https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/README.md
icon: fa fa-circle-thin
type: padding
---

...empty MD section


```


#### Remote Repository
A `remote repo` contains just the front matter section. The real content is crawled during the build process.
A good example is the `./content/050-tutorials/content/app/https/_index.md` page. 

The remote repo is referenced by the `remote` attribute in the front matter.

```md

---
title: HTTPS with self Signed Certificate
description: "HTTPS with self Signed Certificate"
type: tutorial-app
remote: https://github.com/freegroup/kube-https.git
level: intermediate
index: 20
category: Services
scope: app-developer
aliases: ["readmore/https"]
---

# Empty MD section...

```

For all `remote` content the data is crawled during the CI build and integrated into the page.

The `gradener documentation` contains a special section: *How to contribute documentation* which covers
the hugo workflow and some good examples how to format content.
