So, it can potentially be a bottleneck if it is involved in regular health check mechanism for all the etcd clusters it manages.

The general principle is to detect the scenario and take the minimum action to move the cluster along the path to good health. The path from any one scenario to a state of good health will typically involve going through multiple reconciliation actions which probably take the cluster through many other cluster management scenarios.
