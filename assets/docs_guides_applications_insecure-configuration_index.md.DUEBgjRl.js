The proxy will authenticate the client with its own custom method and then issue HTTP requests to the API server with additional HTTP headers specifying the user name and group name. The API server should only accept HTTP requests with HTTP headers from a legitimate proxy. To allow the API server to check incoming requests, you need pass on a list of certificate authorities (CAs) to it. Requests coming from a proxy are only accepted if they use a client certificate that is signed by one of the CAs of that list.</p><div class="language-bash vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">bash</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">--requestheader-client-ca-file</span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">=</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;">/srv/kubernetes/ca/ca-proxy.crt</span></span>

Then, any Kubernetes client certificate can be used to take the role of different user or group as the API server will accept the user header and group header.</p><p>The <code>kubectl</code> tool does not normally add those HTTP headers but it’s pretty easy to generate the corresponding HTTP requests manually.</p><p>We worked on <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/10093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">improving the Kubernetes documentation</a> to make clearer that this configuration should be avoided.</p><h2 id="scenario-2-exploration-of-the-control-plane-network-with-malicious-http-redirects" tabindex="-1">Scenario 2: Exploration of the Control Plane Network with Malicious HTTP-Redirects <a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario-2-exploration-of-the-control-plane-network-with-malicious-http-redirects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scenario 2: Exploration of the Control Plane Network with Malicious HTTP-Redirects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The API server is a central component of Kubernetes and many components initiate connections to it, including the kubelet running on worker nodes. Most of the requests from those clients will end up updating Kubernetes objects (pods, services, deployments, and so on) in the etcd database but the API server usually does not need to initiate TCP connections itself.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""><em>The API server is mostly a component that receives requests</em><br><br><br></p><p>However, there are exceptions. Some <code>kubectl</code> commands will trigger the API server to open a new connection to the kubelet. <code>kubectl exec</code> is one of those commands. In order to get the standard I/Os from the pod, the API server will start an HTTP connection to the kubelet on the worker node where the pod is running. Depending on the container runtime used, it can be done in different ways, but one way to do it is for the kubelet to reply with a HTTP-302 redirection to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Container Runtime Interface (CRI)</a>. Basically, the kubelet is telling the API server to get the streams from CRI itself directly instead of forwarding. The redirection from the kubelet will only change the port and path from the URL; the IP address will not be changed because the kubelet and the CRI component run on the same worker node.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""><em>But the API server also initiates some connections, for example, to worker nodes</em><br><br><br></p><p>It’s often quite easy for users of a Kubernetes cluster to get access to worker nodes and tamper with the kubelet. They could be given explicit SSH access or they could be given a kubeconfig with enough privileges to create privileged pods or even just pods with “host” volumes.</p><p>In contrast, users (even those with “system:masters” permissions or “root” rights) are often not given access to the control plane. On setups like, for example, GKE or Gardener, the control plane is running on separate nodes, with a different administrative access. It could be hosted on a different cloud provider account. So users are not free to explore the internal networking the control plane.</p><p>What would happen if a user was tampering with the kubelet to make it maliciously redirect <code>kubectl exec</code> requests to a different random endpoint? Most likely the given endpoint would not speak to the streaming server protocol, so there would be an error. However, the full HTTP payload from the endpoint is included in the error message printed by kubectl exec.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""><em>The API server is tricked to connect to other components</em><br><br><br></p><p>The impact of this issue depends on the specific setup. But in many configurations, we could find a metadata service (such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AWS metadata service</a>) containing user data, configurations and credentials. The setup we explored had a different AWS account and a different <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EC2 instance profile</a> for the worker nodes and the control plane. This issue allowed users to get access to the AWS metadata service in the context of the control plane, which they should not have access to.</p><p>We have reported this issue to the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes Security mailing list</a> and the public pull request that addresses the issue has been merged <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PR#66516</a>. It provides a way to enforce HTTP redirect validation (disabled by default).</p><p>But there are several other ways that users could trigger the API server to generate HTTP requests and get the reply payload back, so it is advised to isolate the API server and other components from the network as additional precautious measures. Depending on where the API server runs, it could be with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes Network Policies</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EC2 Security Groups</a> or just iptables directly. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">defense in depth principle</a>, it is a good idea to apply the API server HTTP redirect validation when it is available as well as firewall rules.</p><p>In Gardener, this has been fixed with Kubernetes network policies along with changes to ensure the API server does not need to contact the metadata service. You can see more details in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gardener" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">announcements on the Gardener mailing list</a>.
