However, this setup does not bring up a seed cluster, hence, creating a <code>Shoot</code> is not possible. Generally, it would be better if we could harmonize the scenarios such that we only have to maintain one solution.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits</strong>: 👨🏼‍💻 Improved developer productivity, 🧪 increased output qualification.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> A new Skaffold configuration has been created which deploys <code>gardener-operator</code> and its <code>Garden</code> CRD, and later the <code>gardenlet</code> which register the garden cluster as a seed cluster. This also includes the basic Gardener configuration (<code>CloudProfile</code>s, <code>Project</code>s, etc.) and the registration of the <code>provider-local</code> extension. With this setup, it is now possible to create <code>Shoot</code>s as well.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Optimizing the readiness probes to speed up the reconciliation times should be considered.</p><p><strong>Code/Pull Requests</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/9763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/9763</a></p><h2 id="👨🏻‍🌾-extensions-for-garden-cluster-via-gardener-operator" tabindex="-1">👨🏻‍🌾 Extensions For Garden Cluster Via <code>gardener-operator</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#👨🏻‍🌾-extensions-for-garden-cluster-via-gardener-operator" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;👨🏻‍🌾 Extensions For Garden Cluster Via `gardener-operator`&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A Gardener installation usually needs additional and tedious preparation tasks to be done outside &quot;the Kubernetes world&quot;, e.g. creating storage buckets for ETCD backups or managing DNS records for the API server and the ingress controller. All of those could actually be automated via <code>gardener-operator</code> to reduce operational complexity. These tasks even overlap with requirements that have already been implemented for shoot clusters by Gardener extensions, i.e., the code is already available and could be reused.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits</strong>: 🔧 Reduced operational complexity, ✨ support more use cases/scenarios, 📦 provide out-of-the-box solution for Gardener community.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> The <code>Garden</code> controller has been augumented to deploy <code>extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.{BackupBucket,DNSRecord}</code> resources as part of its reconciliation flow. A new <code>operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Extension</code> CRD has been introduced to register extensions on <code>gardener-operator</code> level (specification is similar to <code>Controller{Registration,Deployment}</code>s. Several new controllers have been added to reconcile the new CRDs - the concepts are very similar to what already happens for extensions in the seed cluster and the related existing code in <code>gardenlet</code>. In case the garden cluster is a seed cluster at the same time, multiple instances of the same extension are needed. This requires that we prevent simultaneous reconciliations of the same extension object by different extension controllers. For this purpose, a <code>class</code> field has been added to the extension APIs, and extensions can be configured accordingly to restrict their watches for only objects of a specific <code>class</code>.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Deployment of extension admission components is still missing. Also, validation of the <code>operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Extension</code> as well as tests and documentation is missing. In the future, all <code>BackupBucket</code> and <code>DNSRecord</code> extension controllers must be adapted such that they support the scenario of running in the garden cluster.</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/9635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/9635</a></p><p><strong>Code/Pull Requests</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/metal-stack/gardener/commits/hackathon-gardener-operator-extensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/metal-stack/gardener/commits/hackathon-gardener-operator-extensions/</a></p><h2 id="🪄-gardenlet-self-upgrades-for-unmanaged-seeds" tabindex="-1">🪄 Gardenlet Self-Upgrades For Unmanaged <code>Seed</code>s <a class="header-anchor" href="#🪄-gardenlet-self-upgrades-for-unmanaged-seeds" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🪄 Gardenlet Self-Upgrades For Unmanaged `Seed`s&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> In order to keep <code>gardenlet</code>s in unmanaged seeds up-to-date (i.e., in seeds which are no shoot clusters, like the &quot;root cluster&quot;), its Helm chart must be regularly deployed to it.

It would be much simpler if <code>gardenlet</code> could keep itself up-to-date, based on configuration read from the garden cluster.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits</strong>: 🔧 Reduced operational complexity, ✨ support more use cases/scenarios.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> A new <code>seedmanagement.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Gardenlet</code> resource has been introduced whose specification is similar to the <code>seedmanagement.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.ManagedSeed</code> resource. It allows specifying deployment values (replica count, resource requests, etc.) as well as the <code>gardenlet</code>&#39;s component configuration (feature gates, seed spec, etc.). In addition, the <code>Gardenlet</code> object must contain a URL to an OCI registry storing <code>gardenlet</code>&#39;s Helm chart. A new controller within <code>gardenlet</code> watches such resources, and if needed, downloads the Helm chart and applies it with the provided configuration to its own cluster.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Write unit tests and documentation (including a guide that can be followed when a <code>gardenlet</code> needs to be deployed to a new unmanaged soil/seed cluster).

Currently, the API does not support first-class fields for such operations. Providing Bash scripts that apply the respective configs as part of <code>systemd</code> units is the only option. This makes the development process rather tedious and error-prone.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits</strong>: 👨🏼‍💻 Improved developer productivity.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> The <code>OperatingSystemConfig</code> API has been augmented to support the <code>containerd</code>-config related use-cases existing today. <code>gardener-node-agent</code> has been adapted to evaluate the new fields and apply the respective configs. Managing DNS and/or NTP servers probably needs to be handled by the OS extensions directly so that this information is already available during machine bootstrapping (i.e., before <code>gardener-node-agent</code> starts). The <code>os-gardenlinux</code>, <code>runtime-gvisor</code>, and <code>registry-cache</code> extensions have been adapted to the newly introduced <code>containerd</code>-config API. This allowed deleting a large portion of Bash scripts and related <code>systemd</code> units or <code>DaemonSet</code>s manipulating the host file system. Note that tackling this entire topic only became possible because we have developed <a href="/docs/gardener/concepts/node-agent/"><code>gardener-node-agent</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/gardener-community/hackathon/blob/main/2023-05_Leverkusen/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-introduction-of-gardener-node-agent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">an achievement from one of the previous Hackathons</a>.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> The API adaptations in <code>gardener/gardener</code> have to be finalized first. This includes adding unit tests, augmenting the extension developer documentation, and polishing the code. Once merged and released, the work in the extensions can continue.

Hence, users are limited to use certain ranges (even if they would like to have another network design). Instead of making the VPN network CIDR configurable on seed level, a proper solution is to switch the VPN tunnel to a pure IPv6-based network which can transport both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This is a more mature solution because this lifts the mention CIDR restriction for IPv4 scenarios. For IPv6, the restriction still exists, however, this is not a real concern since the address space is not so scarce compared to the IPv4 world.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits</strong>: 🏗️ Lift restrictions, ✨ support more use cases/scenarios.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> VPN is configured to use IPv6 addresses only (even if the seed and shoot is IPv4-based).

When the VPN connection is broken, <code>kubectl port-forward</code> and <code>kubectl logs</code> continue to work, while <code>kubectl top no</code> (<code>APIServices</code>, <code>Webhooks</code>, etc.) is broken. We should strive towards resolving this discrepancy between the local setup and real-world scenarios regarding the VPN connection to prevent bugs by validating the real setup in e2e tests.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits</strong>: 🧪 Increased output qualification.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> <code>provider-local</code> has been augmented to dynamically create Calico&#39;s <code>IPPool</code> resources. These are used for allocating IP addresses for the shoot worker pods according to the specified node CIDR in <code>.spec.networking.nodes</code>.

The reason is that we use <code>go list</code> to compute all package dependencies of the Gardener binaries, but <code>go list</code> cannot detect embedded files.
