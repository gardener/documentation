Plutono is shipped ready-to-use with a Gardener shoot cluster.</p><p>In order to access the Gardener provided dashboards, open the <code>Plutono</code> link provided in the Gardener dashboard. You will be automatically logged in through OIDC based authentication:</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="access-plutono"></p><p>Access is still possible via the non-OIDC ingress using the credentials from the <code>&lt;clustername&gt;.monitoring</code> secret. It contains the HTTP basic auth credentials in base64-encoded form, as well as the Plutono ingress URL. The Plutono URL is present as an annotation on the <code>.monitoring</code> secret. It can be fetched with <code>kubectl get secret &lt;clustername&gt;.monitoring -o jsonpath=&quot;{.metadata.annotations.url}&quot;</code>. The Prometheus URL can be derived from the Plutono URL by replacing the <code>gu</code> prefix with <code>p</code>.</p><h3 id="accessing-the-dashboards" tabindex="-1">Accessing the Dashboards <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessing-the-dashboards" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accessing the Dashboards&quot;">​</a></h3><p>After logging in, you will be greeted with a Plutono welcome screen.

Plutono uses PromQL queries to query data from Prometheus. It then visualises those metrics in dashboards. Prometheus itself scrapes various targets for metrics, as seen in the diagram below by the arrows pointing to the Prometheus instance.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="data-flow-monitoring-1"></p><p>Let us have a look what metrics we scrape for debugging purposes:</p><p><strong>Container performance metrics</strong></p><p>cAdvisor is an open-source agent integrated into the kubelet binary that monitors resource usage and analyzes the performance of containers. It collects statistics about the CPU, memory, file, and network usage for all containers running on a given node. We use it to scrape data for all pods running in the kube-system namespace in the shoot cluster.</p><p><strong>Hardware and kernel-related metrics</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Prometheus Node Exporter</a> runs as a daemonset in the kube-system namespace of your shoot cluster. It exposes a wide variety of hardware and kernel-related metrics. Some of the metrics we scrape are, for example, the current usage of the filesystem (<code>node_filesystem_free_bytes</code>) or current CPU usage (<code>node_cpu_seconds_total</code>). Both can help you identify if nodes are running out of hardware resources, which could lead to your workload experiencing downtimes.</p><p><strong>Control plane component specific metrics</strong></p><p>The different control plane pods (for example, etcd, API server, and kube-controller-manager) emit metrics over the <code>/metrics</code> endpoint. This includes metrics like how long webhooks take, the request count of the apiserver and storage information, like how many and what kind of objects are stored in etcd.</p><p><strong>Metrics about the state of Kubernetes objects</strong></p><p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">kube-state-metrics</a> is a simple service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects. It is not concerned with metrics about the Kubernetes components, but rather it exposes metrics calculated from the status of Kubernetes objects (for example, resource requests or health of pods).</p><p>In the following image a few example metrics, which are exposed by the various components, are listed: <img src="'+b+'" alt="data-flow-monitoring-2"></p><p>We only store metrics for Gardener deployed components. Those include the Kubernetes control plane, Gardener managed system components (e.g., pods) in the kube-system namespace of the shoot cluster or systemd units on the nodes. We do not gather metrics for workload deployed in the shoot cluster. This is also shown in the picture below.</p><p>This means that for any workload you deploy into your shoot cluster, you need to deploy monitoring and logging yourself.</p><p>Logs or metrics are kept up to 14 days or when a configured space limit is reached.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="data-flow-monitoring-3"></p>',75)]))}const D=o(y,[["render",v]]);export{C as __pageData,D as default};
