To ensure a smooth and safe upgrade, you should follow a specific sequence of steps. This process works with Gardener&#39;s built-in reconciliation and rollout mechanisms, which automatically apply changes across your landscape.</p><h2 id="_1-prepare-before-touching-anything" tabindex="-1">1. Prepare Before Touching Anything <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-prepare-before-touching-anything" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. Prepare Before Touching Anything&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First, understand Gardener&#39;s <a href="/docs/gardener/deployment/version_skew_policy/">version skew policy</a>, which defines which component versions are compatible with each other.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>Please pay special attention to this part of the version skew policy:</p><p><em>&quot;However, given that our release cadence is much more frequent compared to Kubernetes (every <code>14d</code> vs. every <code>120d</code>), in many cases it might be possible to skip minor versions, though we do not test these upgrade paths.</em><em>Consequently, in general it might not work, and to be on the safe side, it is highly recommended to follow the described policy and increment the minor version only one step at a time.&quot;</em></p><p><em>&quot;🚨 Note that downgrading Gardener versions is generally not tested during development and should be considered unsupported.&quot;</em></p></div><p>Next, carefully read the <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">release notes</a> for your target version. The notes will detail any breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. Each release note has target audience:</p><ul><li><code>[USER]</code> (end-users or users of <code>Shoot</code> resources and related configuration)</li><li><code>[OPERATOR]</code> (operators deploying Gardener, managing configuration, seed clusters, etc.)</li><li><code>[DEVELOPER]</code> (developers changing or reviewing code in this repository)</li><li><code>[DEPENDENCY]</code> (developers depending on code in this repository (e.g., extension developers))</li></ul><p>In the context of this guide, you should focus on release notes with <code>[OPERATOR]</code> and <code>[USER]</code> prefixes.</p><h3 id="deprecations-and-backwards-compatibility" tabindex="-1">Deprecations and Backwards-Compatibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#deprecations-and-backwards-compatibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Deprecations and Backwards-Compatibility&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gardener introduces breaking changes cautiously to ensure stability. You can read the full policy <a href="/docs/gardener/process/#deprecations-and-backwards-compatibility">here</a>. The release notes will always highlight when you need to perform manual steps.</p><ul><li>Changes affecting <code>Shoot</code> clusters are typically tied to a Kubernetes minor version upgrade.</li><li>Changes to operator-level APIs (like <code>Garden</code> or <code>Seed</code>) are deprecated for at least three minor releases before being removed.</li><li>For extensions, the deprecation period is even longer, typically nine minor releases.</li></ul><p>If there are breaking changes, you must apply them to your configuration files (manifests) <em>before</em> you update the version numbers. This prevents components from starting with an incompatible configuration.</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>As explained above, changes affecting the <code>Shoot</code> API for <code>[USER]</code>s are typically connected with a Kubernetes minor version upgrade.

Upgrade `gardener-operator` and Gardener Control Plane&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After updating your configuration files, you can deploy the new <code>gardener-operator</code> using its <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/charts/gardener/operator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Helm chart</a>. Once the new operator is running, it will automatically begin updating the <code>Garden</code> resource. This process rolls out the new versions of the Gardener control plane components, such as <code>gardener-apiserver</code> and <code>gardener-controller-manager</code>.</p><h3 id="image-vector-and-overwrites" tabindex="-1">Image Vector and Overwrites <a class="header-anchor" href="#image-vector-and-overwrites" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Image Vector and Overwrites&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gardener components and extensions use an &quot;image vector&quot; to define the specific container images they deploy. If your organization requires using a private container registry, you can replicate the official images and configure Gardener to use them. Follow the instructions <a href="/docs/gardener/deployment/image_vector/">here</a> to create an image vector overwrite.</p><p>Each Gardener release includes a <code>component-descriptor.yaml</code> file as a release asset. This file lists all container images for that version. You can use this list to pull the images, push them to your private registry, and generate the necessary configuration overwrite.</p><h3 id="extensions" tabindex="-1">Extensions <a class="header-anchor" href="#extensions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Extensions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>With <code>gardener-operator</code>, extensions should always be installed via the <code>operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Extension</code> API in the runtime cluster. In order to upgrade them, update their OCI references in these <code>Extension</code> resources.</p><p>In case you also have extensions manually deployed to the (virtual) garden cluster (not recommended), update the version in their <code>ControllerDeployment</code> resources.</p><p>In both cases, make sure to always check the extension&#39;s release notes to ensure compatibility with the Gardener version.</p><h3 id="verify-readiness" tabindex="-1">Verify Readiness <a class="header-anchor" href="#verify-readiness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verify Readiness&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Before moving to the next step, you must verify that the <code>Garden</code> resource has been successfully updated.

This is similar to how Kubernetes upgrades its control plane before the <code>kubelet</code>s on worker nodes.</p><p>Finally, check the health conditions (<code>.status.conditions[]</code>) in the <code>Garden</code> resource to ensure they all report <code>True</code>. Also check the health conditions in the <code>operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Extension</code> resources and ensure they all report <code>True</code>.</p><h2 id="_3-upgrade-your-gardenlets" tabindex="-1">3.

These should be configured using <code>Gardenlet</code> resources in the <code>garden</code> namespace within the (virtual) garden cluster.</p><p>If you&#39;ve enabled auto-updates (by adding the <code>operator.gardener.cloud/auto-update-gardenlet-helm-chart-ref=true</code> label to your <code>Gardenlet</code> resources), the <code>gardener-operator</code> will automatically trigger the upgrade. The <code>gardenlet</code>s will then perform a self-upgrade.</p><p>Alternatively, if you manage your <code>Gardenlet</code> resources with a GitOps tool like Flux, you should not use the auto-update label. Instead, update the Helm chart reference (<code>.spec.deployment.helm.ociRepository.ref</code>) in your configuration and apply the changes yourself.</p><h3 id="managed-seeds" tabindex="-1">Managed Seeds <a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-seeds" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Managed Seeds&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once a <code>gardenlet</code> is upgraded, it automatically begins upgrading any &quot;managed&quot; seeds it controls. No manual action is needed for this step. Note that a <code>ManagedSeed</code> upgrade will wait until any ongoing reconciliation of its underlying <code>Shoot</code> cluster is complete.</p><p>To prevent overloading the system, these upgrades are staggered using a &quot;jitter&quot; period, so they won&#39;t all start at once. By default, this period is 5 minutes. You can adjust it in the <code>gardenlet</code>&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/20-componentconfig-gardenlet.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">component configuration</a> by setting <code>.controllers.managedSeed.syncJitterPeriod</code>. Set it to <code>0</code> to start all upgrades immediately, or increase it if you have many seed clusters to manage the load.</p><h3 id="verify-readiness-1" tabindex="-1">Verify Readiness <a class="header-anchor" href="#verify-readiness-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verify Readiness&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To confirm that all your seed clusters are updated, check the following for each <code>Seed</code> resource:</p><ul><li>The <code>gardener.cloud/operation</code> annotation is removed, indicating the operation is complete.</li><li>The <code>.status.gardener.version</code> field shows your target version.</li><li>The <code>.status.observedGeneration</code> matches the <code>.metadata.generation</code>, meaning the latest configuration has been processed.</li><li>The <code>.status.lastOperation.state</code> is <code>Succeeded</code>.</li></ul><p>Finally, check the health conditions (<code>.status.conditions[]</code>) in the <code>Seed</code> resources to ensure they all report <code>True</code>.</p><h2 id="_4-shoot-reconciliations" tabindex="-1">4. Shoot Reconciliations <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-shoot-reconciliations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4. Shoot Reconciliations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>By default, after a <code>gardenlet</code> is upgraded, it immediately starts reconciling the <code>Shoot</code> clusters it manages. While this is suitable for small setups, it&#39;s often better to perform these reconciliations only during a predefined maintenance window.</p><p>To enable this, set <code>.controllers.shoot.reconcileInMaintenanceOnly=true</code> in the <code>gardenlet</code>&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/20-componentconfig-gardenlet.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">component configuration</a>. When this setting is enabled, all <code>Shoot</code>s will be reconciled during their next scheduled maintenance window, which typically occurs within 24 hours. You can learn more about shoot maintenance <a href="/docs/gardener/shoot/shoot_maintenance/#cluster-reconciliation">here</a>.</p><div class="important custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">IMPORTANT</p><p>Make sure that all <code>Shoot</code>s have been reconciled (even if it failed) with the currently installed Gardener version before upgrading to the next version.

In this case, you need to wait <code>24h</code> before upgrading Gardener again to be on the safe side.</p><p>You can verify that all <code>Shoot</code>s have been reconciled with the current Gardener version by checking that their <code>.status.gardener.version</code> fields show your target version.</p></div><h3 id="operating-system-config-updates" tabindex="-1">Operating System Config Updates <a class="header-anchor" href="#operating-system-config-updates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Operating System Config Updates&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gardener upgrades also roll out new versions of <code>gardener-node-agent</code> which runs on each worker node of all <code>Shoot</code>s. This rollout happens during <code>Shoot</code> reconciliation and could also include other operating system configuration updates. Similar to seed upgrades, such updates to the operating system on <code>Shoot</code> cluster worker nodes are also staggered. This prevents all nodes from being updated simultaneously, which could cause disruptions like <code>kubelet</code> restarts across the entire cluster.</p><p>By default, the rollout across all nodes completes within 5 minutes. You can customize this timeframe by adding the <code>shoot.gardener.cloud/cloud-config-execution-max-delay-seconds</code> annotation to your <code>Shoot</code>s. A value of <code>0</code> updates all nodes in parallel, while a higher value spreads the update over a longer period (up to 1800 seconds).</p>',47)]))}const g=o(n,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
