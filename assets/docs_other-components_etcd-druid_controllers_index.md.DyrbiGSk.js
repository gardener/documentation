It handles the provisioning and management of the etcd cluster.

This is controlled by the <code>--enable-etcd-spec-auto-reconcile</code> CLI flag, which, if set to <code>false</code>, tells the controller to perform reconciliation only when this annotation is present. If the flag is set to <code>true</code>, the controller will reconcile the etcd cluster anytime the <code>Etcd</code> spec, and thus <code>generation</code>, changes, and the next queued event for it is triggered.</p><p>!!! note Creation and deletion of <code>Etcd</code> resources are not affected by the above flag or annotation.</p><p>The reason this filter is present is that any disruption in the <code>Etcd</code> resource due to reconciliation (due to changes in the <code>Etcd</code> spec, for example) while workloads are being run would cause unwanted downtimes to the etcd cluster. Hence, any user who wishes to avoid such disruptions, can choose to set the <code>--enable-etcd-spec-auto-reconcile</code> CLI flag to <code>false</code>. An example of this is Gardener&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/676d1bd9e95d80b9f4bc9c56807806031da5d1ce/docs/concepts/gardenlet.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gardenlet</a>, which reconciles the <code>Etcd</code> resource only during a shoot cluster&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/676d1bd9e95d80b9f4bc9c56807806031da5d1ce/docs/usage/shoot/shoot_maintenance.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>maintenance window</em></a>.</p><p>The controller adds a finalizer to the <code>Etcd</code> resource in order to ensure that it does not get deleted until all dependent resources managed by etcd-druid, aka managed components, are properly cleaned up. Only the <em>etcd controller</em> can delete a resource once it adds finalizers to it. This ensures that the proper deletion flow steps are followed while deleting the resource. During deletion flow, managed components are deleted in parallel.</p><h3 id="etcd-status-updates" tabindex="-1"><code>Etcd</code> Status Updates <a class="header-anchor" href="#etcd-status-updates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`Etcd` Status Updates&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The <code>Etcd</code> resource status is updated periodically by <code>etcd controller</code>, the interval for which is determined by the CLI flag <code>--etcd-status-sync-period</code>.</p><p>Status fields of the <code>Etcd</code> resource such as <code>LastOperation</code>, <code>LastErrors</code> and <code>ObservedGeneration</code>, are updated to reflect the result of the recent reconciliation of the <code>Etcd</code> resource spec.</p><ul><li><code>LastOperation</code> holds information about the last operation performed on the etcd cluster, indicated by fields <code>Type</code>, <code>State</code>, <code>Description</code> and <code>LastUpdateTime</code>. Additionally, a field <code>RunID</code> indicates the unique ID assigned to the specific reconciliation run, to allow for better debugging of issues.</li><li><code>LastErrors</code> is a slice of errors encountered by the last reconciliation run.

For the <code>Status</code> field, the member is checked for the <em>Ready</em> condition, where the member can be in <code>Ready</code>, <code>NotReady</code> and <code>Unknown</code> statuses.</li></ul><p><code>Etcd</code> resource conditions are indicated by status field <code>Conditions</code>. The condition checks that are currently performed are:</p><ul><li><code>AllMembersReady</code>: indicates readiness of all members of the etcd cluster.</li><li><code>Ready</code>: indicates overall readiness of the etcd cluster in serving traffic.</li><li><code>BackupReady</code>: indicates health of the etcd backups, i.e., whether etcd backups are being taken regularly as per schedule. This condition is applicable only when backups are enabled for the etcd cluster.</li><li><code>DataVolumesReady</code>: indicates health of the persistent volumes containing the etcd data.</li><li><code>ClusterIDMismatch</code>: indicates whether the etcd cluster has multiple cluster IDs amongst its members.</li></ul><h2 id="compaction-controller" tabindex="-1">Compaction Controller <a class="header-anchor" href="#compaction-controller" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compaction Controller&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <em>compaction controller</em> deploys the snapshot compaction job whenever required. To understand the rationale behind this controller, please read <a href="/docs/other-components/etcd-druid/proposals/02-snapshot-compaction/">snapshot-compaction.md</a>. The controller watches the number of events accumulated as part of delta snapshots in the etcd cluster&#39;s backups, and triggers a snapshot compaction when the number of delta events crosses the set threshold, which is configurable through the <code>--etcd-events-threshold</code> CLI flag (1M events by default).</p><p>The controller watches for changes in <em>snapshot</em> <code>Leases</code> associated with <code>Etcd</code> resources. It checks the full and delta snapshot <code>Leases</code> and calculates the difference in events between the latest delta snapshot and the previous full snapshot, and initiates the compaction job if the event threshold is crossed.</p><p>The number of worker threads for the <em>compaction controller</em> needs to be greater than or equal to 0 (default 3), controlled by the CLI flag <code>--compaction-workers</code>. This is unlike other controllers which need at least one worker thread for the proper functioning of etcd-druid as snapshot compaction is not a core functionality for the etcd clusters to be deployed. The compaction controller should be explicitly enabled by the user, through the <code>--enable-backup-compaction</code> CLI flag.</p><h2 id="etcdcopybackupstask-controller" tabindex="-1">EtcdCopyBackupsTask Controller <a class="header-anchor" href="#etcdcopybackupstask-controller" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;EtcdCopyBackupsTask Controller&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <em>etcdcopybackupstask controller</em> is responsible for deploying the <a href="https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore/blob/master/cmd/copy.go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>etcdbrctl copy</code></a> command as a job. This controller reacts to create/update events arising from EtcdCopyBackupsTask resources, and deploys the <code>EtcdCopyBackupsTask</code> job with source and target backup storage providers as arguments, which are derived from source and target bucket secrets referenced by the <code>EtcdCopyBackupsTask</code> resource.</p><p>The number of worker threads for the <em>etcdcopybackupstask controller</em> needs to be greater than or equal to 0 (default being 3), controlled by the CLI flag <code>--etcd-copy-backups-task-workers</code>.

The <em>secret controller</em> is registered for <code>Secret</code>s, and the controller keeps a watch on the <code>Etcd</code> CR.
