You&#39;ll learn about targeting, secure shoot cluster access, SSH, and how to use cloud provider CLIs natively.</p><p>The session is led by Lukas Gross, who begins by giving some information on the motivations behind creating a new version of gardenctl - providing secure access to shoot clustes, enabling direct usage of kubectl and cloud provider CLIs and managing cloud provider resources for SSH access.</p><p>Holger Kosser then takes over in order to delve deeper into the concepts behind the implementation of gardenctl-2, going over Targeting, Gardenlogin and Cloud Provider CLIs. After that, Peter Sutter does the first demo, where he presents the main features in gardenctl-2.</p><p>The next part details how to get started with gardenctl, followed by another demo. The landscape requirements are also discussed, as well as future plans and enhancement requests.</p><p>You can find the slides for this community call at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WxvMwdJ1WT2YvTox8Ni_IyX4Qpsz3-87IS5M53FwSvU/edit#slide=id.p8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Slides</a>.</p><p>If you are left with any questions regarding the content, you might find the answers at the Q&amp;A session and discussion held at the end, as well as the questions asked and answered throughout the meeting.</p><h2 id="recording" tabindex="-1">Recording <a class="header-anchor" href="#recording" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Recording&quot;">​</a></h2>',11)),i(t,{videoId:"U1VvyQiE3Jg"})])}const f=a(l,[["render",d]]);export{b as __pageData,f as default};
