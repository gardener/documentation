It does that by annotating the respected resource with <code>gardener.cloud/operation=reconcile</code>. Extension controllers shall react to this annotation and start reconciling the resource. They have to remove this annotation as soon as they begin with their reconcile operation and maintain the <code>status</code> of the extension resource accordingly.</p><p>The reason for this behaviour is that it is possible to configure Gardener to reconcile only in the shoots&#39; maintenance time windows. In order to avoid that, extension controllers reconcile outside of the shoot&#39;s maintenance time window we have introduced this contract. This way extension controllers don&#39;t need to care about when the shoot maintenance time window happens. Gardener keeps control and decides when the shoot shall be reconciled/updated.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/extensions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">extension controller library</a> provides all the required utilities to conveniently implement this behaviour.</p>',4)]))}const u=t(i,[["render",a]]);export{p as __pageData,u as default};
