There is an upstream Cluster Autoscaler project that does exactly this. It simulates the scheduling and reacts to pods not being schedulable events. Gardener has forked it to make it work with machine-controller-manager abstraction of how node (groups) are defined in Gardener. The cluster autoscaler respects the limits (min / max) of any worker pool in a shoot&#39;s spec. It can also scale down nodes based on utilization thresholds.
