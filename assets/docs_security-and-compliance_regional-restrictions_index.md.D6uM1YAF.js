And just like how most cloud providers offer means to fulfil regional restrictions, Gardener also has some means built in for this purpose. Similarly, Gardener also follows a shared responsibility model where users are obliged to use the provided Gardener means in a way which results in compliance with regional restrictions.</p><h3 id="regions" tabindex="-1">Regions <a class="header-anchor" href="#regions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Regions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gardener users need to understand that Gardener is a generic tool and has no built-in knowledge about regions as geographical or political conglomerates. For Gardener, regions are only strings. To create regional restrictions is an obligation of all Gardener users who orchestrate existing Gardener functionality to reach evidence which can be audited later on.</p><h3 id="support-for-regional-restrictions" tabindex="-1">Support for Regional Restrictions <a class="header-anchor" href="#support-for-regional-restrictions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Support for Regional Restrictions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gardener offers functionality to support the most important kind of regional restrictions in its global setup:</p><ul><li><strong>No Restriction:</strong> All seeds in all regions can be allowed to host the control plane of all shoots.</li><li><strong>Restriction by Dedication:</strong> Shoots running in a region can be configured so that only dedicated seeds in dedicated regions are allowed to host the shoot’s control plane.
