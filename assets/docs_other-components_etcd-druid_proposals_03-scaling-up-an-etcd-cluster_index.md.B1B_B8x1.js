However, while scaling up from single node etcd to multi-node etcd, there will be a requirement to have peer communication between members of the etcd cluster. Peer communication is required for various reasons, for instance for members to sync up cluster state, data, and to perform leader election or any cluster wide operation like removal or addition of a member etc. Hence in a multi-node etcd cluster we need to have TLS enable peer URL for peer communication.</li><li>Providing the correct configuration to start new etcd members as it is different from boostrapping a cluster since these new etcd members will join an existing cluster.</li></ol><h2 id="approach" tabindex="-1">Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We first went through the etcd doc of <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/runtime-configuration/#update-advertise-peer-urls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">update-advertise-peer-urls</a> to find out information regarding peer URL updation.

The statefulset controller will then bring up new pods(etcd with backup-restore as a sidecar). Now etcd&#39;s sidecar i.e backup-restore will check whether this member is already a part of a cluster or not and incase it is unable to check (may be due to some network issues) then backup-restore checks presence of this annotation: <code>gardener.cloud/scaled-to-multi-node</code> in etcd statefulset to detect scale-up. If it finds out it is the scale-up case then backup-restore adds new etcd member as a <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.3/learning/learner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">learner</a> first and then starts the etcd learner by providing the correct configuration.
