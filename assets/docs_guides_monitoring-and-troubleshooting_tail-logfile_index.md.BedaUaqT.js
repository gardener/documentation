A simple <code>tail -f &lt;path-to-logfile&gt;</code> isn&#39;t possible at all. Certainly, you can use <code>kubectl logs -f &lt;pod-id&gt;</code>, but it doesn&#39;t help if you want to monitor more than one pod at a time.</p><p>This is something you really need a lot, at least if you run several instances of a pod behind a <code>deployment</code>. This is even more so if you don&#39;t have a Kibana or a similar setup.</p><img src="'+l+'" alt="howto-kubetail" width="100%"><h2 id="solution" tabindex="-1">Solution <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Solution&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Luckily, there are smart developers out there who always come up with solutions. The <strong>finding of the week</strong> is a small bash script that allows you to aggregate log files of several pods at the same time in a simple way. The script is called <code>kubetail</code> and is available at <a href="https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>',7)]))}const m=t(n,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
