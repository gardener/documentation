Wireguard is a relatively new, but well-liked contender in the VPN space. It could be possible to replace OpenVPN with Wireguard. As we do not want to spin up a load balancer per control plane (or use one port per control plane) a reverse proxy like <a href="https://github.com/apernet/mwgp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">mwgp</a> is required.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits:</strong> 🚀 Modernize VPN stack, ⚡️ improved performance and simplicity.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> We have a POC for VPN via Wireguard connection for one shoot with local setup and the local setup for extensions.

Since we introduce OpenTelemetry collector instance on the shoots as a replacement of valitail service and on seeds in the shoot control plane namespace, the goal is to try out collecting and filtering the shoot metrics via OpenTelemetry collector instances also giving the opportunity for filtering and fine-tuning of the metrics sets.

For example, traffic across availability zone boundaries may have increased latency or monetary costs. There are tools, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/retina" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/microsoft/retina</a>, which allow to gain more detailed insights into the pod network, but may lack some features like availability zone tracking (see <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/retina/issues/1179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/microsoft/retina/issues/1179</a>).</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits:</strong> 👁️‍🗨️ Enhanced network visibility, 📈 actionable insights for optimization.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> The retina tool was successfully enhanced to also label source and destination zones of the traffic.

This could lead to a bad-actor manipulating these secrets to deploy resources with the permissions of the GRM. To prevent one potential scenario of privilege escalation, we want to sign the secrets of <code>ManagedResource</code>s with a key that is only known to the Gardener Resource Manager. This way, the grm can verify that the secrets it receives are not manipulated by a bad actor.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits:</strong> 🔒 Improved security and integrity for managed resources.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> A PoC was created that demonstrates that signing of <code>ManagedResource</code> secrets is possible.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> There are still some open questions, as well as testing which needs to be followed up on.</p><p><strong>Code/Pull Requests:</strong><a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12247</a></p><h2 id="🧰-migrate-control-plane-reconciliation-of-provider-extensions-to-managedresources" tabindex="-1">🧰 Migrate Control Plane Reconciliation of Provider Extensions to <code>ManagedResource</code>s <a class="header-anchor" href="#🧰-migrate-control-plane-reconciliation-of-provider-extensions-to-managedresources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🧰 Migrate Control Plane Reconciliation of Provider Extensions to `ManagedResource`s&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Currently we deploy control-plane components using the chart applier instead of managed-resources.

However, cluster internal traffic like from gardener-resource-manager and gardener-controller-manager accesses the Kubernetes internal services directly, skips Istio and so the L7 load-balancing. We noticed at least for gardener-controller-manager that it could generate some load to the gardener-apiserver. Thus, it would be nice to have a cluster internal load-balancing too. We don&#39;t want to use the external endpoint since depending on the infrastructure this could create additional external traffic.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits:</strong> ⚖️ Better resource distribution, 🚦 improved reliability for internal traffic.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> Cluster internal L7 load balancing was implemented by leveraging generic token kubeconfig, creating a dedicated clusterIP service for Istio ingress gateway pods, and introducing a pod-kube-apiserver-load-balancing webhook to inject necessary configurations into control plane pods.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Merge the PR.</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong><a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/8810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/8810</a></p><p><strong>Code/Pull Requests:</strong><a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/12260</a></p><h2 id="📜-documentation-revamp" tabindex="-1">📜 Documentation Revamp <a class="header-anchor" href="#📜-documentation-revamp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;📜 Documentation Revamp&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Usually, the individual content of our documentation is of high quality and helpful.

Canary Deployments)&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Gardener currently has very tight versioning constraints. For example, it is not possible to have multiple versions of the same extension type running on the same seed cluster. Therefore, previous ideas around canary deployments ended with the direction to make control plane migration as easy/fast/reliable as possible so that the control planes can be moved between seeds running with different versions of gardenlet/extensions. A different approach, favoured by this proposal, would be to make it possible to run multiple version in parallel on a single seed cluster with filters in place so that individual control plane components are still reconciled only by one set of version. This would allow multiple &quot;channel&quot; in the same landscape, e.g. alpha, beta, GA.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits:</strong> 🦜 Enable canary/parallel versioning, 🔄 safer rollouts.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> It was discovered that the current implementation allows to roll out different versions across different seeds.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> There are still some caveats which require further discussion, which will be followed up on.</p><h2 id="♻️-gep-32-–-version-classification-lifecycles-🏎️" tabindex="-1">♻️ GEP-32 – Version Classification Lifecycles 🏎️ <a class="header-anchor" href="#♻️-gep-32-–-version-classification-lifecycles-🏎️" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;♻️ GEP-32 – Version Classification Lifecycles 🏎️&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Last Gardener Hackathon we implemented Version Classification Lifecycles in the (Namespaced) Cloud Profile, proposed the GEP-32, but we couldn&#39;t find enough time to finish the required pull requests for the actual implementation.</p><p><strong>Motivation/Benefits:</strong> ♻️ Automated version lifecycle management, ⏳ reduced manual effort.</p><p><strong>Achievements:</strong> The previous PR was rebased and confirmed to still be working.
