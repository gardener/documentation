We know that Kubernetes is infrastructure agnostic with the help of a provider specific <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cloud Controller Manager</a>. But Kubernetes has explicitly externalized the management of the nodes. Once they appear - correctly configured - in the cluster, Kubernetes can use them. If nodes fail, Kubernetes can&#39;t do anything about it, external tooling is required. But every tool, every provider is different. So, why not elevate node management to a first class Kubernetes citizen? Why not create a Kubernetes native resource that manages machines just like pods? Such an approach is brought to you by the <a href="https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Machine Controller Manager</a> (aka MCM), which, of course, is an open sourced project. MCM gives you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>seamlessly manage machines/nodes with a declarative API (of course, across different cloud providers)</li><li>integrate generically with the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cluster autoscaler</a></li><li>plugin with tools such as the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">node-problem-detector</a></li><li>transport the immutability design principle to machine/nodes</li><li>implement e.g. rolling upgrades of machines/nodes</li></ul><h2 id="machine-controller-manager-aka-mcm" tabindex="-1">Machine Controller Manager aka MCM <a class="header-anchor" href="#machine-controller-manager-aka-mcm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Machine Controller Manager aka MCM&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Machine Controller Manager</a> is a group of cooperative controllers that manage the lifecycle of the worker machines. It is inspired by the design of Kube Controller Manager in which various sub controllers manage their respective Kubernetes Clients.</p><p>Machine Controller Manager reconciles a set of Custom Resources namely <code>MachineDeployment</code>, <code>MachineSet</code> and <code>Machines</code> which are managed &amp; monitored by their controllers <code>MachineDeployment Controller</code>, <code>MachineSet Controller</code>, <code>Machine Controller</code> respectively along with another cooperative controller called the <code>Safety Controller</code>.</p><h2 id="understanding-the-sub-controllers-and-custom-resources-of-mcm" tabindex="-1">Understanding the sub-controllers and Custom Resources of MCM <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-the-sub-controllers-and-custom-resources-of-mcm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Understanding the sub-controllers and Custom Resources of MCM&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Custom Resources <code>MachineDeployment</code>, <code>MachineSet</code> and <code>Machines</code> are very much analogous to the native K8s resources of <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ReplicaSet</code> and <code>Pods</code> respectively. So, in the context of MCM:</p><ul><li><code>MachineDeployment</code> provides a declarative update for <code>MachineSet</code> and <code>Machines</code>. <code>MachineDeployment Controller</code> reconciles the <code>MachineDeployment</code> objects and manages the lifecycle of <code>MachineSet</code> objects. <code>MachineDeployment</code> consumes a provider specific <code>MachineClass</code> in its <code>spec.template.spec</code>, which is the template of the VM spec that would be spawned on the cloud by MCM.</li><li><code>MachineSet</code> ensures that the specified number of <code>Machine</code> replicas are running at a given point of time. <code>MachineSet Controller</code> reconciles the <code>MachineSet</code> objects and manages the lifecycle of <code>Machine</code> objects.</li><li><code>Machines</code> are the actual VMs running on the cloud platform provided by one of the supported cloud providers. <code>Machine Controller</code> is the controller that actually communicates with the cloud provider to create/update/delete machines on the cloud.</li><li>There is a <code>Safety Controller</code> responsible for handling the unidentified or unknown behaviours from the cloud providers.</li><li>Along with the above Custom Controllers and Resources, MCM requires the <code>MachineClass</code> to use K8s <code>Secret</code> that stores cloudconfig (initialization scripts used to create VMs) and cloud specific credentials.</li></ul><h2 id="workings-of-mcm" tabindex="-1">Workings of MCM <a class="header-anchor" href="#workings-of-mcm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Workings of MCM&quot;">​</a></h2><img title="Figure 1: In-Tree Machine Controller Manager" src="'+n+'" style="width:90%;height:auto;"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:30px;font-size:90%;">Figure 1: In-Tree Machine Controller Manager</figcaption><p>In MCM, there are two K8s clusters in the scope — a <em>Control Cluster</em> and a <em>Target Cluster</em>. The Control Cluster is the K8s cluster where the MCM is installed to manage the machine lifecycle of the Target Cluster. In other words, the Control Cluster is the one where the machine-* objects are stored. The Target Cluster is where all the node objects are registered. These clusters can be two distinct clusters or the same cluster, whichever fits.</p><p>When a <code>MachineDeployment</code> object is created, the <code>MachineDeployment Controller</code> creates the corresponding <code>MachineSet</code> object. The <code>MachineSet Controller</code> in-turn creates the <code>Machine</code> objects. The <code>Machine Controller</code> then talks to the cloud provider API and actually creates the VMs on the cloud.</p><p>The cloud initialization script that is introduced into the VMs via the K8s <code>Secret</code> consumed by the <code>MachineClasses</code> talks to the KCM (K8s Controller Manager) and creates the node objects. After registering themselves to the Target Cluster, nodes start sending health signals to the machine objects. That is when MCM updates the status of the machine object from <code>Pending</code> to <code>Running</code>.</p><h2 id="more-on-safety-controller" tabindex="-1">More on Safety Controller <a class="header-anchor" href="#more-on-safety-controller" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;More on Safety Controller&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Safety Controller contains the following functions:</p><h3 id="orphan-vm-handling" tabindex="-1">Orphan VM Handling <a class="header-anchor" href="#orphan-vm-handling" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Orphan VM Handling&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>It lists all the VMs in the cloud; matching the tag of given cluster name and maps the VMs with the <code>Machine</code> objects using the <code>ProviderID</code> field.

It can, of course, be easily extended to support other cloud providers.</p><p>Going ahead, having the implementation of the Machine Controller Manager supporting too many cloud providers would be too much upkeep from both a development and a maintenance point of view. Which is why the <code>Machine Controller</code> component of MCM has been moved to Out-of-Tree design, where the <code>Machine Controller</code> for each respective cloud provider runs as an independent executable, even though typically packaged under the same deployment.</p><img title="Figure 2: Out-Of-Tree Machine Controller Manager" src="'+i+'" style="width:90%;height:auto;"><figcaption style="text-align:center;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:30px;font-size:90%;">Figure 2: Out-Of-Tree (OOT) Machine Controller Manager</figcaption><p>This OOT Machine Controller will implement a common interface to manage the VMs on the respective cloud provider. Now, while the <code>Machine Controller</code> deals with the <code>Machine</code> objects, the Machine Controller Manager (MCM) deals with higher level objects such as the <code>MachineSet</code> and <code>MachineDeployment</code> objects.</p><p>A lot of contributions are already being made towards an OOT Machine Controller Manager for various cloud providers.
