With the recent changes, the <code>Seed</code> specification has been extended with a new <code>.spec.dns.internal</code> field. This allows operators to define internal DNS settings on a per-seed basis.</p>\\n<p>The new <code>SeedDNSProviderConfig</code> object includes the following fields:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>type</code>: The DNS provider type (e.g., <code>aws-route53</code>, <code>local</code>).</li>\\n<li><code>domain</code>: The internal domain name to be used by the provider.</li>\\n<li><code>zone</code> (optional): The specific zone where DNS records are managed.</li>\\n<li><code>credentialsRef</code>: A reference to a <code>Secret</code> that holds the credentials for authenticating with the DNS provider.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This new approach offers several advantages:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Granular Control:</strong> Operators can now configure different internal domains and credentials for each <code>Seed</code>, reducing the blast radius in case a secret is compromised. This also helps in avoiding potential rate limits from DNS providers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Explicit and Validated:</strong> By moving the configuration into an explicit API field, it becomes easier to validate and is less prone to errors than the previous implicit, label-based discovery mechanism.</li>\\n<li><strong>Future-Ready:</strong> The API is designed to support other credential types in the future, such as <code>WorkloadIdentity</code>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"migration-path-for-operators\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Migration Path for Operators <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#migration-path-for-operators\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Migration Path for Operators&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>To ensure a smooth transition, Gardener provides an automatic migration path. On startup, a <code>gardenlet</code> will check if the <code>.spec.dns.internal</code> field is set for its <code>Seed</code>. If the field is empty, <code>gardenlet</code> will automatically populate it by reading the configuration from the existing globally-defined internal domain <code>Secret</code>.</p>\\n<p>However, this automatic population is a temporary measure to facilitate migration. Operators are required to adapt their <code>Seed</code> manifests and configuration templates to explicitly define the <code>.spec.dns.internal</code> block.</p>\\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> The <code>.spec.dns.internal</code> field will become a <strong>mandatory configuration</strong> after the release of Gardener <strong>v1.129.0</strong>.</p>\\n<p>This enhancement is the first step in improving DNS configuration management.

A rolling update involves creating new machines before terminating old ones, causing the total machine count to temporarily exceed the desired replica count. The health check logic would often interpret this state as a scale-down event, reporting the reason <code>NodesScalingDown</code>. This was confusing because the cluster was actively rolling out new infrastructure, not reducing its capacity.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\"a-more-precise-health-check\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">A More Precise Health Check <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#a-more-precise-health-check\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;A More Precise Health Check&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>To resolve this ambiguity, the health check logic has been refined to be more context-aware. The controller now specifically detects when a <code>MachineDeployment</code> is in the middle of a rolling update by inspecting its <code>MachineDeploymentProgressing</code> condition.</p>\\n<p>When this condition is active and indicates that a new machine set is being rolled out, the controller assigns a new, more descriptive status: <code>NodesRollOutScalingUp</code>. This status is prioritized over other scaling-related conditions, ensuring that operators receive the most accurate information possible. Instead of seeing a confusing <code>NodesScalingDown</code> message, they will now see a clear indication that a planned node rollout is in progress.</p>\\n<p>This improvement provides operators with a much clearer understanding of the cluster's state. The enhanced accuracy reduces confusion during maintenance activities and helps distinguish a normal rolling update from an unintended scaling issue, leading to more confident and effective cluster management.</p>\\n","date":{"time":1750852800000,"string":"June 25, 2025"}},{"title":"Enhancing Meltdown Protection with Dependency-Watchdog Annotations","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-25-enhancing-meltdown-protection-with-dependency-watchdog-annotations","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750852800000,"string":"June 25, 2025"}},{"title":"Improving Credential Management for Seed Backups","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-25-improving-credential-management-for-seed-backups","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750852800000,"string":"June 25, 2025"}},{"title":"Introducing \`gardenadm bootstrap\` for Autonomous Shoots","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-25-introducing-gardenadm-bootstrap-for-autonomous-shoots","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750852800000,"string":"June 25, 2025"}},{"title":"Enhanced Extension Management: Introducing \`autoEnable\` and \`clusterCompatibility\`","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-18-enhanced-extension-management-introducing-autoenable-and-clustercompatibility","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750248000000,"string":"June 18, 2025"}},{"title":"Enhanced Internal Traffic Management: L7 Load Balancing for kube-apiservers in Gardener","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-18-enhanced-internal-traffic-management-l7-load-balancing-for-kube-apiservers-in-gardener","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750248000000,"string":"June 18, 2025"}},{"title":"Gardener Enhances Observability with OpenTelemetry Integration for Logging","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-18-gardener-enhances-observability-with-opentelemetry-integration-for-logging","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750248000000,"string":"June 18, 2025"}},{"title":"Taking Gardener to the Next Level: Highlights from the 7th Gardener Community Hackathon in Schelklingen","url":"/blog/2025/06/06-17-Taking-Gardener-to-the-Next-Level-Highlights-from-the-7th-Gardener-Community-Hackathon-in-Schelklingen","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1750161600000,"string":"June 17, 2025"}},{"title":"Fine-Tuning kube-proxy Readiness: Ensuring Accurate Health Checks During Node Scale-Down","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-21-fine-tuning-kube-proxy-readiness-ensuring-accurate-health-checks-during-node-scale-down","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747828800000,"string":"May 21, 2025"}},{"title":"New in Gardener: Forceful Redeployment of gardenlets for Enhanced Operational Control","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-21-new-in-gardener-forceful-redeployment-of-gardenlets-for-enhanced-operational-control","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747828800000,"string":"May 21, 2025"}},{"title":"Streamlined Node Onboarding: Introducing \`gardenadm token\` and \`gardenadm join\`","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-21-streamlined-node-onboarding-introducing-gardenadm-token-and-gardenadm-join","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747828800000,"string":"May 21, 2025"}},{"title":"Enhanced Network Flexibility: Gardener Now Supports CIDR Overlap for Non-HA Shoots","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-19-enhanced-network-flexibility-gardener-now-supports-cidr-overlap-for-non-ha-shoots","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747656000000,"string":"May 19, 2025"}},{"title":"Enhanced Node Management: Introducing In-Place Updates in Gardener","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-19-enhanced-node-management-introducing-in-place-updates-in-gardener","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747656000000,"string":"May 19, 2025"}},{"title":"Gardener Dashboard 1.80: Streamlined Credentials, Enhanced Cluster Views, and Real-Time Updates","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-19-gardener-dashboard-180-streamlined-credentials-enhanced-cluster-views-and-real-time-updates","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747656000000,"string":"May 19, 2025"}},{"title":"Gardener: Powering Enterprise Kubernetes at Scale and Europe's Sovereign Cloud Future","url":"/blog/2025/05/05-12-Gardener-NeoNephos","excerpt":"","date":{"time":1747051200000,"string":"May 12, 2025"}},{"title":"Leaner Clusters, Lower Bills: How Gardener Optimized Kubernetes Compute Costs","url":"/blog/2025/04/04-17-Leaner-Clusters-Lower-Bills","excerpt":"<h1 id=\\"leaner-clusters-lower-bills-how-gardener-optimized-kubernetes-compute-costs\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Leaner Clusters, Lower Bills: How Gardener Optimized Kubernetes Compute Costs <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#leaner-clusters-lower-bills-how-gardener-optimized-kubernetes-compute-costs\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Leaner Clusters, Lower Bills: How Gardener Optimized Kubernetes Compute Costs&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h1>\\n<p>As organizations embrace Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale, the underlying infrastructure costs, particularly for compute resources, become a critical factor. Gardener, the open-source Kubernetes management platform, empowers organizations like SAP, STACKIT, T-Systems, and others (see <a href=\\"https://gardener.cloud/adopter\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">adopters</a>) to operate tens of thousands of Kubernetes clusters efficiently across diverse environments. Gardener's role as a core technology in initiatives like <a href=\\"https://neonephos.org/projects\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">NeoNephos</a>, aimed at advancing digital autonomy in Europe (see <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85MDID9Ju04&amp;t=621s\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">KubeCon London 2025 Keynote</a> and <a href=\\"https://linuxfoundation.eu/newsroom/the-linux-foundation-announces-the-launch-of-neonephos-to-advance-digital-autonomy-in-europe\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">press announcement</a>), further underscores the need for cost-effective and sustainable operations.</p>\\n<p>At the heart of Gardener's architecture is the concept of &quot;Kubeception&quot; (see <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/gardener?tab=readme-ov-file#gardener\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">readme</a> and <a href=\\"/docs/gardener/concepts/architecture/\\">architecture</a>): Gardener runs <em>on</em> Kubernetes (called a <strong>runtime cluster</strong>), facilitates access <em>through</em> a self-managed node-less Kubernetes cluster (called the <strong>garden cluster</strong>), manages Kubernetes control planes as pods <em>within</em> self-managed Kubernetes clusters that provide high scalability to Gardener (called <strong>seed clusters</strong>), and <em>provisions</em> end-user Kubernetes clusters (called <strong>shoot clusters</strong>). Therefore, optimizing Gardener's own Kubernetes-related resource consumption directly translates into cost savings across all these layers, benefiting both Gardener service providers and the end-users consuming the managed clusters.</p>\\n<p>While infrastructure costs span compute, storage, and networking, compute resources (the virtual machines running Kubernetes nodes) typically represent the largest share of the bill. Over the past years, the Gardener team has undertaken a significant effort to optimize these costs. This blog post details our journey, focusing heavily on the compute optimizations that go beyond standard autoscaling practices, ultimately delivering substantial savings that benefit the entire Gardener ecosystem.</p>\\n<p>We'll build upon the foundations laid out in our <a href=\\"/docs/guides/applications/shoot-pod-autoscaling-best-practices/\\">Pod Autoscaling Best Practices Guide</a>. You may want to check it out beforehand, as we'll only touch upon a few key recommendations from it in this blog post, not delving into the full depth required for effective pod autoscaling – a prerequisite for the compute optimizations discussed here.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"visibility-and-initial-measures\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Visibility and Initial Measures <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#visibility-and-initial-measures\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Visibility and Initial Measures&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h2>\\n<h3 id=\\"know-your-spending-leveraging-observability-and-iaas-cost-tools\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Know Your Spending: Leveraging Observability and IaaS Cost Tools <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#know-your-spending-leveraging-observability-and-iaas-cost-tools\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Know Your Spending: Leveraging Observability and IaaS Cost Tools&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>You can't optimize what you can't measure. Our first step was to gain deep visibility into our spending patterns. We leveraged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>IaaS Cost Reports &amp; Alerts:</strong> Regularly analyzing detailed cost breakdowns from cloud providers (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Billing Reports) helped us identify major cost drivers across compute, storage, and network usage. Setting up alerts for cost anomalies makes us aware of regressions and unexpected budget overruns.</li>\\n<li><strong>Cloud Provider Recommendation Tools:</strong> Tools like AWS Trusted Advisor, Azure Advisor's Cost recommendations, and Google Cloud's machine type rightsizing recommendations provided initial, manual pointers towards obvious inefficiencies like underutilized virtual machines or suboptimal instance types.</li>\\n<li><strong>Internal Usage Reports:</strong> We generated custom reports detailing our own resource consumption. This helped identify and drive down the number and uptime of development and other non-production clusters. Automating the configuration of Gardener's <a href=\\"/docs/gardener/shoot/shoot_hibernate/\\">cluster hibernation feature</a> or reporting on clusters with poor hibernation schedules further curbed unnecessary spending. These insights are now integrated into the Gardener Dashboard (our GUI).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"the-reserved-instance-savings-plan-imperative-planning-for-discounts\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">The Reserved Instance / Savings Plan Imperative: Planning for Discounts <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#the-reserved-instance-savings-plan-imperative-planning-for-discounts\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;The Reserved Instance / Savings Plan Imperative: Planning for Discounts&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>Cloud providers offer significant discounts for commitment: Reserved Instances (RIs) on AWS/Azure, Savings Plans (SPs) on AWS/Azure, and Committed Use Discounts (CUDs) on GCP. However, maximizing their benefit requires careful planning, which is not the primary subject of this blog post. Companies typically have tools that generate recommendations from cost reports, suggesting the purchase of new RIs, SPs, or CUDs if on-demand usage consistently increases. Two key learnings emerged in this context, though:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Coordination between Operations and Controlling:</strong> We discovered that technical optimizations and discount commitment purchases <em>must</em> go hand-in-hand. A significant 20% utilization improvement can be completely negated if the remaining workload runs on expensive on-demand instances because the RI/SP/CUD purchase didn't account for the change. On-demand pricing can easily be twice or more expensive than committed pricing.</li>\\n<li><strong>Commitments vs. Spot Pricing:</strong> While Spot Instances/Preemptible virtual machines offer deep discounts, their ephemeral nature makes them unsuitable for critical control plane components. For predictable baseline workloads, well-planned RIs/SPs/CUDs provide substantial, reliable savings and are often more beneficial overall. Spot Instance/Preemptible VM discounts are generally not higher than, and often less than, RI/SP/CUD discounts for comparable commitment levels.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"early-wins-finding-and-eliminating-resource-waste\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Early Wins: Finding and Eliminating Resource Waste <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#early-wins-finding-and-eliminating-resource-waste\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Early Wins: Finding and Eliminating Resource Waste&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>We also actively looked for waste, specifically orphaned resources. Development and experimentation inevitably lead to forgotten resources (virtual machines, disks, load balancers, etc.). We implemented processes like requiring all resources to include a personal identifier in the name or as a label/tag to facilitate later cleanup. Initially, we generated simple reports, but it became clear that this task required a more professional approach. Unaccounted-for resources aren't just costly; they can also pose security risks or indicate security incidents. Therefore, we developed the <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/inventory\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\"><code>gardener/inventory</code></a> tool. This tool understands Gardener installations and cross-references expected cloud provider resources (based on Gardener's desired state and implementation) against actually existing resources. It acts as an additional safety net, alerting on discrepancies (e.g., unexpected load balancers for a seed, unmanaged virtual machines in a VPC) which could indicate either cost leakage or a potential security issue, complementing Gardener's existing security measures like high-frequency credentials rotation, image signing and admission, network policies, Falco, etc.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\"consolidation-avoiding-a-fragmented-seed-landscape\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Consolidation: Avoiding a Fragmented Seed Landscape <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#consolidation-avoiding-a-fragmented-seed-landscape\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Consolidation: Avoiding a Fragmented Seed Landscape&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>If possible, avoid operating too many small seeds unless required by regulations or driven by end-user demand. As Gardener supports control plane migration, you can consolidate your control planes into fewer, larger seeds where reasonable. Since starting Gardener in production in 2017, we've encountered technological advancements (e.g., Azure Availability Sets to Zones) and corrected initial misconfigurations (e.g., too-small CIDR ranges limiting pod/node counts) that necessitated recreating seeds. While hard conflicts (like seed/shoot cluster IP address overlaps) can sometimes block migration to differently configured seeds, you can often at least merge multiple seeds into one or fewer. The key takeaway is that a less fragmented seed landscape generally leads to better efficiency.</p>\\n<p>However, there is a critical caveat: Gardener allows control planes to reside in different regions (or even different cloud providers) than their worker nodes. This flexibility comes at the cost of inter-regional or internet network traffic. These additional network-related costs can easily negate efficiency gains from seed consolidation. Therefore, consolidate thoughtfully, being mindful that excessive consolidation across regions can significantly increase network costs (intra-region traffic is cheaper than inter-region traffic, and internet traffic is usually the most expensive).</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"quick-wins-in-networking-and-storage\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Quick Wins in Networking and Storage <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#quick-wins-in-networking-and-storage\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Quick Wins in Networking and Storage&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h2>\\n<p>While compute was our main focus, we also addressed significant cost drivers in networking and storage early on.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\"centralized-ingress-caching\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Centralized Ingress &amp; Caching <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#centralized-ingress-caching\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Centralized Ingress &amp; Caching&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Ingress:</strong> In Gardener's early days, each shoot control plane had its own Load Balancer (LB), plus another for the reverse tunnel connection to worker nodes (to reach webhooks, scrape metrics, stream logs, <code>exec</code> into pods, etc.). This proliferation of LBs was expensive. We transitioned to a model using a central Istio ingress-gateway per seed cluster with a single LB, leveraging SNI (Server Name Indication) routing to direct traffic to the correct control plane API servers. We also reversed the connection direction: shoots now connect <em>to</em> seed clusters, and seeds connect <em>to</em> the garden cluster. This reduced the need for LBs exposing seed components and enabled <em>private</em> shoots or even <em>private</em> seeds behind firewalls.</li>\\n<li><strong>Registry Cache:</strong> Pulling container images for essential components (like CNI, CSI drivers, kube-proxy) on every new node startup generated significant network traffic and costs. We implemented a <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-registry-cache\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">registry cache extension</a>, drastically reducing external image pulls (see <a href=\\"/blog/2024/04-22-gardener's-registry-cache-extension-another-cost-saving-win-and-more/\\">blog post</a>).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"smarter-networking-habits\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Smarter Networking Habits <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#smarter-networking-habits\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Smarter Networking Habits&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Efficient API Usage:</strong> Well-implemented controllers use <code>watch</code> requests rather than frequent <code>list</code> requests to minimize API server load and improve responsiveness. Leveraging server-side filtering via <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">label selectors</a> and <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/field-selectors\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">field selectors</a> reduces the amount of data transferred.</li>\\n<li><strong>Reducing Cross-Zonal Traffic:</strong> Data transfer between availability zones, necessary for highly available control planes, is generally more expensive than within a single zone. We enabled Kubernetes' <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/topology-aware-hints\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">Topology Aware Routing</a> to help route API server traffic within the same zone where possible, reducing cross-zonal traffic and therefore costs (see <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues/6718\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">Gardener Issue #6718</a>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoiding Large Resources:</strong> Storing large amounts of data directly in Kubernetes resources (ConfigMaps, Secrets) is inefficient and strains etcd and the network. We utilize blob stores for large payloads, such as control plane etcd or state backups used for automated restoration or control plane migration (with data compressed and encrypted in transit and at rest).</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Monitoring:</strong> Implementing regression monitoring for network traffic helped catch seemingly innocent code changes that could inadvertently cause massive spikes in data transfer costs.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"conscious-storage-consumption\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Conscious Storage Consumption <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#conscious-storage-consumption\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Conscious Storage Consumption&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>Storage costs were addressed by being mindful of Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) size and performance tiers (e.g., standard HDD vs. premium SSD).

For cost optimization, <em>packing</em> pods tightly onto fewer nodes (using the <code>MostAllocated</code> strategy, often called bin-packing) is more effective. Gardener runs Kubernetes control planes as pods on seed clusters. Switching the Kube-Scheduler profile in our seed clusters to prioritize bin-packing yielded over 20% reduction in machine costs for these clusters simply by requiring fewer nodes. We also made this scheduling profile available for shoot clusters (see <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/6251\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">Gardener PR #6251</a>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pod Priorities:</strong> Assigning proper <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">Pod Priorities</a> is important not just for stability but also for cost. High-priority pods (like control plane components) can preempt lower-priority pods if necessary, reducing the need to maintain excess capacity just in case a critical pod needs scheduling space. This avoids unnecessary over-provisioning.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"voluntary-disruptions-pod-disruption-budgets\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Voluntary Disruptions: Pod Disruption Budgets <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#voluntary-disruptions-pod-disruption-budgets\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Voluntary Disruptions: Pod Disruption Budgets&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Pod Disruption Budgets:</strong> Defining proper <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)</a> helps manage and steer voluntary disruptions safely.

We observed nodes becoming pod-bound (unable to schedule more pods despite available CPU/memory). To prevent this, ensure you configure the following:\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Sufficient IP Addresses</strong>: Provide a large enough <code>--node-cidr-mask-size</code> (e.g., <code>/22</code> for ~1024 IPs, though assume ~80% effective due to IP reuse; see <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">kube-controller-manager docs</a>) to allocate sufficient IPs per node.</li>\\n<li><strong>Kubelet Capacity</strong>: Set an increased <code>--max-pods</code> value (see <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">kubelet docs</a>) to inform the kubelet and scheduler of the node's actual pod capacity.</li>\\n<li><strong>Reserved Resources</strong>: Allocate sufficient <code>--kube-reserved</code> resources (again, see <a href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">kubelet docs</a>) to account for system overhead from the increased pod count.</li>\\n<li><strong>ARP Cache Tuning</strong>: When running a high number of pods (e.g., 400 or more), the default kernel ARP cache size may be insufficient, leading to an &quot;ARP cache overflow.&quot; This triggers constant, CPU-intensive garbage collection, which can destabilize the node and cause networking failures. To mitigate this, you should increase the ARP cache garbage collection thresholds.

We found <code>maxAllowed</code> couldn't be configured centrally in the VPA controller, so we contributed this feature upstream (see <a href=\\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/7147\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">Kubernetes Autoscaler Issue #7147</a> and <a href=\\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/7560\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">corresponding PR</a>).</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Set Pod Requests:</strong> We always set CPU and memory requests for our containers or let VPA manage those.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tune Pod Requests:</strong> We systematically processed hundreds of components:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Some deployments were placed under VPA management. Others (very small, below VPA's resolution of ~10m cores / 10Mi memory) were removed from VPA and given static requests.</li>\\n<li><strong>&quot;Initial&quot; Requests:</strong> For pods managed by VPA, we set initial requests to the observed P5 (5th percentile) of historical usage. This provides a reasonable starting point for VPA.</li>\\n<li><strong>&quot;Static&quot; Requests:</strong> For pods not managed by VPA, we set requests to the P95 (95th percentile). This ensures they generally have enough resources; only exceptional spikes might cause issues, where VPA wouldn't typically help either.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong> Prefer the <code>Burstable</code> QoS class (requests set, ideally no limits) for most workloads. Avoid <code>BestEffort</code> (no requests/limits), as these pods are the first to be evicted under pressure. Avoid <code>Guaranteed</code> (requests match limits), as limits often cause more harm than good. See our <a href=\\"/docs/guides/applications/shoot-pod-autoscaling-best-practices/#quality-of-service-qos\\">Pod Autoscaling Best Practices Guide</a>. Pods in the <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS class, or generally those with limits, will be actively CPU-throttled and can be OOMKilled even if the node has ample spare capacity. Worse, if containers in the pod are under VPA, their CPU requests/limits often won't scale up appropriately because CPU throttling goes unnoticed by VPA.\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Avoid Limits:</strong> In Gardener's context (and often also elsewhere), setting CPU limits offers few advantages and significant disadvantages, primarily unnecessary throttling. Setting memory limits <em>can</em> prevent runaway processes but may also prematurely kill pods. We generally avoid setting limits unless the theoretical maximum resource consumption of a component is well understood. When unsure, let VPA manage requests and rely on monitoring/alerting for excessive usage.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\"data-driven-machine-type-selection\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Data-Driven Machine Type Selection <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#data-driven-machine-type-selection\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Data-Driven Machine Type Selection&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h2>\\n<h3 id=\\"continuous-monitoring-understanding-how-well-our-machines-are-utilized\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Continuous Monitoring: Understanding How Well Our Machines are Utilized <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#continuous-monitoring-understanding-how-well-our-machines-are-utilized\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Continuous Monitoring: Understanding How Well Our Machines are Utilized&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>Before optimizing machine type selection, we established comprehensive machine utilization monitoring. This was important during individual improvement steps to validate their effectiveness. We collect key metrics per Gardener installation, cloud provider, seed, and worker pool, and created dashboards to visualize and monitor our machine costs. These dashboards include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Total CPU [in thousand cores], Total Memory [in TB], Total Number of Control Planes [count]</li>\\n<li>Used Capacity CPU [%], Used Capacity Memory [%], Unused vs. Capacity Cost [Currency]</li>\\n<li>Requested Allocatable CPU [%], Requested Allocatable Memory [%], Unrequested vs. Allocatable Cost [Currency]</li>\\n<li>Used Requested CPU [%], Used Requested Memory [%], Unused vs. Requested Cost [Currency]</li>\\n<li>Used Reserved CPU [%, can exceed 100%], Used Reserved Memory [%, can exceed 100%], Unused vs. Reserved Cost [Currency]</li>\\n<li>Nodes with &gt;99% filling levels, broken down by CPU, memory, volumes, and pods (to identify the most critical resource blocking further usage)</li>\\n<li>Effective CPU:memory ratio of the workload (more on that later)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"why-machine-types-matter-size-ratios-generations-and-hidden-constraints\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Why Machine Types Matter: Size, Ratios, Generations, and Hidden Constraints <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#why-machine-types-matter-size-ratios-generations-and-hidden-constraints\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;Why Machine Types Matter: Size, Ratios, Generations, and Hidden Constraints&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>Selecting the right machine type is critical for cost efficiency. Several factors come into play:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger machines generally lead to less fragmentation (less wasted CPU/memory remainder per node) and better overhead efficiency (system components like kubelet/containerd consume a smaller percentage of total resources). However, smaller machines can be better for low-load scenarios while meeting high-availability constraints (e.g., needing to spread critical pods across 3 zones requires at least 3 nodes).</li>\\n<li><strong>CPU:Memory Ratio:</strong> Cloud providers offer instance families with different CPU:memory ratios (e.g., high-cpu 1:2, standard 1:4, high-memory 1:8). Matching the instance ratio to your workload's aggregate CPU:memory request ratio minimizes waste.</li>\\n<li><strong>Generations:</strong> Newer instance generations usually offer better performance and, crucially, better price-performance. This can also shift the effective CPU:memory ratio required by the workload due to performance differences.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hidden Constraints: Volume Limits:</strong> This proved to be a <em>major</em> factor, especially on AWS and Azure. Each instance type has a maximum number of network-attached volumes it can support. Gardener control planes, each with its own etcd cluster requiring persistent volumes for each replica, are heavily impacted. We often found ourselves limited by volume attachments long before hitting CPU or memory limits. Interestingly, ARM-based instance types on Azure support a slightly higher volume limit.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\"the-case-for-dedicated-pools-isolating-workloads\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">The Case for Dedicated Pools: Isolating Workloads <a class=\\"header-anchor\\" href=\\"#the-case-for-dedicated-pools-isolating-workloads\\" aria-label=\\"Permalink to &quot;The Case for Dedicated Pools: Isolating Workloads&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h3>\\n<p>While mixing diverse workloads seems efficient at first glance, dedicated node pools for specific workload types proved beneficial for several reasons:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Handling <a href=\\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\"><code>safe-to-evict: false</code></a>:</strong> Some pods (like single-replica stateful components for non-HA clusters) cannot be safely evicted by the Cluster Autoscaler. Mixing these with evictable pods on the same node can prevent the CA from scaling down that node, even if it's underutilized, negating cost savings. Placing these non-evictable pods in a dedicated pool (where scale-down might be disabled or carefully managed) isolates this behavior.</li>\\n<li><strong>Volume Concentration:</strong> Our &quot;etcd&quot; worker pools host primarily etcd pods (high volume count) and daemonsets, while &quot;standard&quot; pools host API servers, controllers, etc. (lower volume concentration). This difference influences the optimal machine type due to volume attachment limits.</li>\\n<li><strong>Preventing Scheduling Traps:</strong> Ensure critical, long-running pods (like Istio gateways) have node affinities/selectors to land only on their preferred, optimized node pools. Avoid them landing on temporary, large nodes spun up for short-lived bulky pods; if such a pod prevents the large node from scaling down (e.g., because the pool is at its minimum node count), the CA won't automatically replace the underutilized large node with a smaller one.

href=\\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/setup-extension-api-server/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">extension API server</a>\\nthat comes along with a bundle of custom controllers.\\nIt introduces new API objects in an existing Kubernetes cluster (which is called a <strong>garden</strong> cluster) in order to use them for the\\nmanagement of end-user Kubernetes clusters (which are called <strong>shoot</strong> clusters).\\nThese shoot clusters are described via <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">declarative cluster specifications</a> which are observed by the controllers.\\nThey will bring up the clusters, reconcile their state, perform automated updates and make sure they are always up and running.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>This means that Gardener, just like any Kubernetes controller, creates Kubernetes clusters (Shoots) using a reconciliation loop.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\"/docs/gardener/concepts/gardenlet/\\">Gardenlet</a> contains the controller and reconciliation loop responsible for the creation, update, deletion, and migration of Shoot clusters (there are more, but we spare them in this article).\\nIn addition, the <a href=\\"/docs/gardener/concepts/controller-manager/\\">Gardener Controller Manager</a> also reconciles Shoot resources, but only for seed-independent functionality such as Shoot hibernation, Shoot maintenance or quota control.</p>\\n<p>This blog post is about the reconciliation loop in the Gardenlet responsible for creating and updating Shoot clusters.\\nThe code can be found in the <a href=\\"https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/pkg/gardenlet/controller/shoot/shoot/reconciler_reconcile.go\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">gardener/gardener repository</a>.\\nThe reconciliation loops of the extension controllers can be found in their individual repositories.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\"shoot-reconciliation-flow-diagram\\" tabindex=\\"-1\\">Shoot

Diagram&quot;\\">&ZeroWidthSpace;</a></h2>\\n<p>When Gardner creates a Shoot cluster, there are three conceptual layers involved: the Garden cluster, the Seed cluster and the Shoot cluster.\\nEach layer represents a top-level section in the diagram (similar to a lane in a BPMN diagram).</p>\\n<p>It might seem confusing that the Shoot cluster itself is a layer, because the whole flow in the first place is about creating the Shoot cluster.\\nI decided to introduce this separate layer to make a clear distinction between which resources exist in the Seed API server (managed by Gardener) and which in the Shoot API server (accessible by the Shoot owner).</p>\\n<p>Each section contains several components.\\nComponents are mostly Kubernetes resources in a Gardener installation (e.g. the gardenlet deployment in the Seed cluster).</p>\\n<p>This is the list of components:</p>\\n<p><strong>(Virtual) Garden Cluster</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Gardener Extension API
