This provides operators with greater control and a streamlined recovery path for specific scenarios.</p><h3 id="the-standard-gardenlet-lifecycle" tabindex="-1">The Standard gardenlet Lifecycle <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-standard-gardenlet-lifecycle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Standard gardenlet Lifecycle&quot;">​</a></h3><p>gardenlets, crucial components in the Gardener architecture, are typically deployed into seed clusters. For setups utilizing the <code>seedmanagement.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Gardenlet</code> resource, particularly in unmanaged seeds (those not backed by a shoot cluster and <code>ManagedSeed</code> resource), the <code>gardener-operator</code> handles the initial deployment of the gardenlet.</p><p>Once this initial deployment is complete, the gardenlet takes over its own lifecycle, leveraging a self-upgrade strategy to keep itself up-to-date. Under normal circumstances, the <code>gardener-operator</code> does not intervene further after this initial phase.</p><h3 id="when-things-go-awry-the-need-for-intervention" tabindex="-1">When Things Go Awry: The Need for Intervention <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-things-go-awry-the-need-for-intervention" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When Things Go Awry: The Need for Intervention&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While the self-upgrade mechanism is robust, certain situations can arise where a gardenlet might require a more direct intervention. For example:</p><ul><li>The gardenlet&#39;s client certificate to the virtual garden cluster might have expired or become invalid.</li><li>The gardenlet <code>Deployment</code> in the seed cluster might have been accidentally deleted or become corrupted.</li></ul><p>In such cases, because the <code>gardener-operator</code>&#39;s responsibility typically ends after the initial deployment, the gardenlet might not be able to recover on its own, potentially leading to operational issues.</p><h3 id="empowering-operators-the-force-redeploy-annotation" tabindex="-1">Empowering Operators: The Force-Redeploy Annotation <a class="header-anchor" href="#empowering-operators-the-force-redeploy-annotation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Empowering Operators: The Force-Redeploy Annotation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To address these challenges, Gardener now allows operators to instruct the <code>gardener-operator</code> to forcefully redeploy a gardenlet. This is achieved by annotating the specific <code>Gardenlet</code> resource with:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>gardener.cloud/operation=force-redeploy</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When this annotation is applied, it signals the <code>gardener-operator</code> to re-initiate the deployment process for the targeted gardenlet, effectively overriding the usual hands-off approach after initial setup.</p><h3 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1">How It Works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How It Works&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The process for a forceful redeployment is straightforward:</p><ol><li>An operator identifies a gardenlet that requires redeployment due to issues like an expired certificate or a missing deployment.</li><li>The operator applies the <code>gardener.cloud/operation=force-redeploy</code> annotation to the corresponding <code>seedmanagement.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Gardenlet</code> resource in the virtual garden cluster.</li><li><strong>Important:</strong> If the gardenlet is for a remote cluster and its kubeconfig <code>Secret</code> was previously removed (a standard cleanup step after initial deployment), this <code>Secret</code> must be recreated, and its reference (<code>.spec.kubeconfigSecretRef</code>) must be re-added to the <code>Gardenlet</code> specification.</li><li>The <code>gardener-operator</code> detects the annotation and proceeds to redeploy the gardenlet, applying its configurations and charts anew.</li><li>Once the redeployment is successfully completed, the <code>gardener-operator</code> automatically removes the <code>gardener.cloud/operation=force-redeploy</code> annotation from the <code>Gardenlet</code> resource. Similar to the initial deployment, it will also clean up the referenced kubeconfig <code>Secret</code> and set <code>.spec.kubeconfigSecretRef</code> to <code>nil</code> if it was provided.</li></ol><h3 id="benefits" tabindex="-1">Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefits&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This new feature offers significant advantages for Gardener operators:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Recovery:</strong> Provides a clear and reliable mechanism to recover gardenlets from specific critical failure states.</li><li><strong>Improved Operational Flexibility:</strong> Offers more direct control over the gardenlet lifecycle when exceptional circumstances demand it.</li><li><strong>Reduced Manual Effort:</strong> Streamlines the process of restoring a misbehaving gardenlet, minimizing potential downtime or complex manual recovery procedures.</li></ul><p>This enhancement underscores Gardener&#39;s commitment to operational excellence and responsiveness to the needs of its user community.</p><h3 id="dive-deeper" tabindex="-1">Dive Deeper <a class="header-anchor" href="#dive-deeper" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dive Deeper&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To learn more about this feature, you can explore the following resources:</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub Pull Request:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/11972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gardener/gardener#11972</a></li><li><strong>Official Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/docs/deployment/deploy_gardenlet_via_operator.md#forceful-re-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Forceful Re-Deployment of gardenlets</a></li><li><strong>Community Meeting Recording (starts at the relevant segment):</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/ssvXpPliOY0?t=338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gardener Review Meeting on YouTube</a></li></ul>',23)]))}const g=r(n,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
