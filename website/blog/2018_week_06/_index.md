Docker for Mac 17.12 CE (and higher) Edge includes a standalone Kubernetes server that runs on Mac, 
so that you can test deploying your Docker workloads on Kubernetes.

The Kubernetes client command, kubectl, is included and configured to connect to the local Kubernetes server. 
If you have kubectl already installed and pointing to some other environment, such as minikube or a GKE cluster, 
be sure to change context so that kubectl is pointing to docker-for-desktop:

I recommend to [setup your shell](/howto/kube-shell) to see which KUBECONFIG is active.
