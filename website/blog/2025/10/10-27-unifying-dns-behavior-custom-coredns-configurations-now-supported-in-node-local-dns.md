Gardener is committed to making `node-local-dns` a standard feature across all shoot clusters to enhance DNS performance and reliability. A recent enhancement ensures that enabling this feature is a seamless experience, even for clusters with specialized DNS configurations. Gardener now supports applying custom CoreDNS rules directly within `node-local-dns`.

### The Challenge: Inconsistent DNS Resolution

Previously, enabling `node-local-dns` could alter the expected DNS resolution behavior for operators who defined custom rules in the `coredns-custom` ConfigMap. The `node-local-dns` agent, which acts as a DNS cache on each node, is designed to forward requests to either the in-cluster CoreDNS or directly to upstream DNS servers.

This created a problem: if a user configured a custom rule (for example, to rewrite an external domain to a cluster-internal service), `node-local-dns` might forward the request directly to an upstream server, bypassing the main CoreDNS and ignoring the custom rule. This resulted in failed requests and inconsistent behavior compared to clusters without `node-local-dns`.

### The Solution: Applying Custom Rules to the Node Cache

To address the inconsistency, Gardener now automatically mounts the `coredns-custom` ConfigMap into the `node-local-dns` pods. The Corefile for `node-local-dns` has been updated to include any custom server blocks (generated-config/custom-server-block.server) or override rules (custom/*.override) specified in this ConfigMap. To get the correct server blocks, a sidecar container is added to the `node-local-dns` pods. This sidecar reads the server blocks from the `coredns-custom` ConfigMap and generates a new configuration file with the appropriate bind statement and port mappings. This newly generated configuration file is then imported into the `node-local-dns` pods.

This change ensures that the same custom DNS logic is applied at the node-level cache, before any requests are forwarded. As a result, DNS resolution remains consistent whether `node-local-dns` is active or not, and the previous workaround of forcing all requests through the central CoreDNS is no longer necessary.
