# Gardener at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, London 2025

The open-source project [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) is set to showcase its cutting-edge Kubernetes-as-a-Service (KaaS) capabilities at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) 2025 in London.

Gardener has been pioneering hosted control planes long before they became mainstream and is now the default choice within SAP and [other organizations](https://gardener.cloud/adopter/) for provisioning Kubernetes clusters.
Organizations looking to transform their Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) into a Kubernetes-as-a-Service (KaaS) platform can experience Gardener’s powerful automation, security, and multi-cloud extensibility firsthand at the event or [directly in the browser](https://demo.gardener.cloud/).

## Revolutionizing Kubernetes Management with Gardener

Gardener provides a fully managed Kubernetes cluster solution that is:
- **Infinitely Extensible:** Gardener offers limitless extensibility, supporting AWS, Azure, Alicloud, GCP, OpenStack, and other infrastructures. Run nodes with Garden Linux, SuSE, Ubuntu, or Flatcar OS while utilizing runc or gVisor for container runtime flexibility and Calico or Cilium for CNI. Explore the [Gardener Extensions Library](https://gardener.cloud/docs/extensions/) for even more customization options.
- **Automated Lifecycle Management:** Simplified provisioning, scaling, and updates with built-in automation.
- **Security & Compliance:** Enforced policies and strict isolation to meet regulatory and enterprise security requirements, with support for automated credential rotation.
- **Multi-Tenancy & Cost Efficiency:** Designed for organizations running at scale, optimizing resources without sacrificing performance.

Also, explore our other open-source projects:

**[etcd-druid](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-druid/)** – Our in-house operator responsible for managing etcd instances in Gardener’s hosted control planes, ensuring the stability and performance of Kubernetes clusters.

**[openMCP](https://github.com/openmcp-project)** – Our latest open-source offering that enables organizations to streamline application development using control plane methodology, making it easy to roll out, upgrade, and replicate cloud environments securely and seamlessly.

As Kubernetes adoption continues to accelerate, Gardener remains the go-to choice for managing Kubernetes at scale across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Stop by our booth **_S561_** at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025 to experience Gardener firsthand and meet the team to see how Gardener empowers organizations to run secure, scalable, and efficient Kubernetes clusters with ease.
