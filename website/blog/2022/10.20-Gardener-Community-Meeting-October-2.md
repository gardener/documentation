## Presenters

This community call will be led by [Pawel Palucki](https://github.com/ppalucki) and [Alexander D. Kanevskiy](https://github.com/kad).

## Topicss

Alexander Kanevskiy begins the community call by giving an overview of [CRI-resource-manager](https://github.com/intel/cri-resource-manager), describing it as a "hardware aware container runtime", and also going over what it brings to the user in terms of features and policies.

Pawel Palucki continues by giving details on the policy that will later be used in the demo and the use case demonstrated in it. He then goes over the "must have" features of any extension - observability and the ability to deploy and configure objects with it. 

The demo then begins, mixed with slides giving further information at certain points regarding the installation process, static and dynamic configuration flow, healthchecks and recovery mode, and access to logs, among others.

The presentation is concluded by Pawel showcasing the new features coming to CRI-resource-manager with its next releases and sharing some tips for other extension developers.

If you are left with any questions regarding the content, you might find the answers at the Q&A session and discussion held at the end, as well as the questions asked and answered throughout the meeting.
