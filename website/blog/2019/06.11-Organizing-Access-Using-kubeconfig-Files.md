The kubectl command-line tool uses `kubeconfig` files to find the information it needs in order to choose a cluster and 
communicate with its API server.

### What happens if your kubeconfig file of your production cluster is leaked or published by accident?

way to protect your infrastructure or application if the kubeconfig has leaked - **delete the cluster**.
