**Should I use:**
<ul style="list-style:none">
    <li>❌ one namespace per user/developer?</li>
    <li>❌ one namespace per team?</li>
    <li>❌ one per service type?</li>
    <li>❌ one namespace per application type?</li>
    <li>😄 <b>one namespace per running instance of your application?</b></li>
</ul>

**Apply the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)**
 
All user accounts should run **as few privileges as possible** at all times, and also launch applications with as few privileges as possible. If you share a cluster for a different user separated by a `namespace`, **the user has access to all `namespaces`** and 
services per default. It can happen that a user **accidentally uses and destroys** the `namespace` of a productive application or the `namespace` of another developer.

**Keep in mind - By default namespaces don't provide:**
 - Network Isolation
 - Access Control
 - Audit Logging on user level
