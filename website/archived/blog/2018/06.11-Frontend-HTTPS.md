For encrypted communication between the client and the load balancer, you need to specify a TLS private key and certificate to be used by the ingress controller.

Create a secret in the namespace of the ingress containing the TLS private key and certificate. Then configure the secret name in the TLS configuration section of the ingress specification.

Learn more on [HTTPS - Self Signed Certificates](https://github.com/freegroup/kube-https/blob/master/README.md) to find out how to configure it.
