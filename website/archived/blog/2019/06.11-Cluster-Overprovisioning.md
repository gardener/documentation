# Cluster Overprovisioning

A tutorial was added that describes how to create an overprovisioning of cluster nodes for scaling and failover. This is desired when you have a work load that you need to scale up quickly without waiting for the new cluster nodes to be created and join the cluster.

A similar problem occurs when crashing a node from the Hyperscaler. This must be replaced by Kubernetes as fast as possible. The solution can be the **overprovisioning** of nodes.
