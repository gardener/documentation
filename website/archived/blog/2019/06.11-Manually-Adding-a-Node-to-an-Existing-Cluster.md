Gardener has an excellent ability to [automatically scale machines](../2021/01.25-machine-controller-manager.md) for the cluster. From the point of view of scalability, there is **no need for manual intervention**.

This tutorial is useful for those end-users who need specifically configured nodes, which are not yet supported by Gardener. For example: an end-user who wants some workload that requires `runnc` instead of `runc` as container runtime.
