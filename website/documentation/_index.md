# Gardener Documentation

## First Steps with Gardener

If you're new to Gardener, we recommend starting with our [Getting Started](./getting-started/_index.md) guide to understand the basic concepts.

For an easy-to-grasp analogy of how Gardener works, check out [Podrick and the Infinite Garden](./getting-started/podrick-and-the-infinite-garden.md).

## Support

- **Community Support**: Join our [community channels](../community/_index.md) to connect with other Gardener users and contributors
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gardener/gardener)
