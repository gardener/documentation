# Gardener Documentation

<!-- # Welcome to Gardener Documentation -->

## First Steps with Gardener

If you're new to Gardener, we recommend starting with our [Getting Started](./getting-started/_index.md) guide to understand the basic concepts.

For an easy to grasp analogy of how Gardener works, check out [Podrick and the Infinite Garden](./getting-started/podrick-and-the-infinite-garden.md).

## Understanding the Documentation Personas

Our documentation is organized around three user personas to help you find the most relevant content for your needs. Below you will find more information on each of them.

> [!NOTE]
> You can switch between personas through the Documentation drop-down menu in the top navigation bar.

### User

You are a **User** if you:

- Create and manage Kubernetes clusters (shoots) using Gardener
- Work with Gardener through the Dashboard or API
- Configure cluster specifications, extensions, and networking
- Have access to shoot clusters but not to the underlying seed infrastructure

User documentation focuses on how to use Gardener to create, configure, and manage your Kubernetes clusters.

### Operator

You are an **Operator** if you:

- Run and maintain Gardener landscapes
- Manage seed clusters and infrastructure
- Configure Gardener components and extensions
- Handle platform-level operations and monitoring
- Provide Gardener as a service to end-users

Operator documentation covers installation, configuration, maintenance, and operational aspects of running Gardener.

### Developer

You are a **Developer** if you:

- Contribute to Gardener core components
- Develop Gardener extensions or integrations
- Work on the Gardener codebase
- Need to understand Gardener's internal architecture and APIs

Developer documentation includes architecture details, development guides, API references, and contribution guidelines.
