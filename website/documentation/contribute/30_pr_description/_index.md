## Writing Release Notes

Some guidelines and tips for writing release notes include:
- Be as descriptive as needed.
- Only use lists if you are describing multiple different additions.
- You can freely use [markdown formatting](../20_documentation/20_formatting_guide/_index.md#formatting-of-inline-elements), including links.

You can find various examples in the Releases sections of the [gardener/documentation](https://github.com/gardener/documentation/releases) and [gardener/gardener](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/releases) repositories.
