title: Shortcodes
---

Shortcodes are the Hugo way to extend the limitations of Markdown before resorting to HTML. There are a number of built-in shortcodes available from Hugo. This list is extended with Gardener website shortcodes designed specifically for its content.
Find a complete reference to the Hugo built-in shortcodes on its [website](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

Below is a reference to the shortcodes developed for the Gardener website.

## alert
```
{{%/* alert color="info" title="Notice" */%}}
text
{{%/* /alert */%}}
```
produces
{{% alert color="info" title="Notice" %}}
A notice disclaimer
{{% /alert %}}

All the color options are `info`|`warning`|`primary`

You can also omit the title section from an alert, useful when creating notes. 

It is important to note that the text that the "alerts" shortcode wraps will not be processed during site building. Do not use shortcodes in it. 

You should also avoid mixing HTML and markdown formatting in shortcodes, since it won't render correctly when the site is built. 

### Alert Examples

{{% alert color="info" %}}
Info color
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Warning color
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="primary" %}}
Primary color
{{% /alert %}}

## mermaid
The [GitHub mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) fenced code block syntax is used. You can find additional documentation at [mermaid's official website](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/README).

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result one]
    C -->|Two| E[Result two]
```
~~~

produces:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result one]
    C -->|Two| E[Result two]
```

Default settings can be overridden using the %%init%% header at the start of the diagram definition.
