Shortcodes are the Hugo way to extend the limitations of Markdown before resorting to HTML. There are a number of built-in shortcodes available from Hugo. This list is extended with Gardener website shrotcodes designed specifically for its content.
Find a complete reference to the Hugo built-in shortcodes on its [website](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

Below is a reference to the shortcodes developed for the Gardener website.

## alert
```
{{%/* alert color="info" */%}}
text
{{%/* /alert */%}}
```

A notice disclaimer
{{% /alert %}}
Except `info` other options are `info`|`warning`|`primary`.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
The text that the "alerts" shortcode wraps will not be processed during site building. Do not use shortcodes in it.
