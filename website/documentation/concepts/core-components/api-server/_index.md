# Gardener API server

The Gardener API server is a Kubernetes-native extension based on its [aggregation layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/).
It is registered via an `APIService` object and designed to run inside a Kubernetes cluster whose API it wants to extend.

After registration, it exposes the following resources:

## `CloudProfile`s

`CloudProfile`s are resources that describe a specific environment of an underlying infrastructure provider, e.g. AWS, Azure, etc.
Each shoot has to reference a `CloudProfile` to declare the environment it should be created in.
In a `CloudProfile` the gardener operator specifies certain constraints like available machine types, regions, which Kubernetes versions he wants to offer, etc.
End-users can read `CloudProfile`s to see these values, but only operators can change the content or create/delete them.
When a shoot is created or updated then an admission plugin checks that only values are used that are allowed via the referenced `CloudProfile`.

Additionally, a `CloudProfile` may contain a `providerConfig` which is a special configuration dedicated for the infrastructure provider.
Gardener does not evaluate or understand this config, but extension controllers might need for declaration of provider-specific constraints, or global settings.

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/30-cloudprofile.yaml) example manifest and consult the documentation of your provider extension controller to get information about its `providerConfig`.

## `Seed`s

`Seed`s are resources that represent seed clusters.
Gardener does not care about how a seed cluster got created - the only requirement is that it is of at least Kubernetes v1.11 and passes the Kubernetes conformance tests.
The Gardener operator has to either deploy the Gardenlet into the cluster he wants to use as seed (recommended, then the Gardenlet will create the `Seed` object itself after bootstrapping), or he provides the kubeconfig to the cluster inside a secret (that is referenced by the `Seed` resource) and creates the `Seed` resource himself.

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/45-secret-seed-backup.yaml), [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/50-seed.yaml)(, and optionally [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/40-secret-seed.yaml)) example manifests.

## `Quota`s

In order to allow end-user not having their own dedicated infrastructure account to try out Gardener the operator can register an account owned by him that he allows to be used for trial clusters.
Trial clusters can be put under quota such that they don't consume too many resources (resulting in costs), and so that one user cannot consume all resources on his own.
These clusters are automatically terminated after a specified time, but end-users may extend the lifetime manually if needed.

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/60-quota.yaml) example manifest.

## `Project`s

The first thing before creating a shoot cluster is to create a `Project`.
A project is used to group multiple shoot clusters together.
End-users can invite colleagues to the project to enable collaboration, and they can either make them `admin` or `viewer`.
After an end-user has created a project he will get a dedicated namespace in the garden cluster for all his shoots.

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/05-project-dev.yaml) example manifest.

## `SecretBinding`s

Now that the end-user has a namespace the next step is registering his infrastructure provider account.

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/70-secret-provider.yaml) example manifest and consult the documentation of the extension controller for the respective infrastructure provider to get information about which keys are required in this secret.

After the secret has been created the end-user has to create a special `SecretBinding` resource that binds this secret.
Later when creating shoot clusters he will reference such a binding.

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/80-secretbinding.yaml) example manifest.

## `Shoot`s

Shoot cluster contain various settings that influence how end-user Kubernetes clusters will look like in the end.
As Gardener heavily relies on extension controllers for operating system configuration, networking, and infrastructure specifics, the end-user has the possibility (and responsibility) to provide these provider-specific configurations as well.
Such configurations are not evaluated by Gardener (because it doesn't know/understand them), but they are only transported to the respective extension controller.

:warning: This means that any configuration issues/mistake on the end-user side that relates to a provider-specific flag or setting cannot be caught during the update request itself but only later during the reconciliation (unless a validator webhook has been registered in the garden cluster by an operator).

Please see [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gardener/gardener/master/docs/concepts/../../example/90-shoot.yaml) example manifest and consult the documentation of the provider extension controller to get information about its `spec.provider.controlPlaneConfig`, `.spec.provider.infrastructureConfig`, and `.spec.provider.workers[].providerConfig`.

## `(Cluster)OpenIDConnectPreset`s
