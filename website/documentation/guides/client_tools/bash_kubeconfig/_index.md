Use the Kubernetes command-line tool, *kubectl*, to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes. 
Using kubectl, you can inspect cluster resources; create, delete, and update components

By default, the kubectl configuration is located at `~/.kube/config`.


Suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for scratch work.

How to handle this easily without copying the used configuration always to the right place? 

## Export the KUBECONFIG enviroment variable
```sh 
bash$ export KUBECONFIG=<PATH-TO-M>-CONFIG>/kubeconfig-dev.yaml
```

How to determine which cluster is used by the kubectl command?


## Determine active cluster
```sh 
bash$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://api.dev.garden.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
KubeDNS is running at https://api.dev.garden.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
bash$ 
```


## Display cluster in the bash - Linux and alike
I found this tip on Stackoverflow and find it worth to be added here.
Edit your `~/.bash_profile` and add the following code snippet to show the current k8s 
context in the shell's prompt.

```sh
prompt_k8s(){
  k8s_current_context=$(kubectl config current-context 2> /dev/null)
  if [[ $? -eq 0 ]] ; then echo -e "(${k8s_current_context}) "; fi
}
 
 
PS1+='$(prompt_k8s)'

```

After this your bash command prompt contains the active KUBECONFIG context and you always know
which cluster is active - *develop* or *production*. 

e.g.

```sh 
bash$ export KUBECONFIG=/Users/d023280/Documents/workspace/gardener-ui/kubeconfig_gardendev.yaml 
bash (garden_dev)$ 
```

Note the **(garden_dev)** prefix in the bash command prompt.

**This helps immensely to avoid thoughtless mistakes.**

## Display cluster in the PowerShell - Windows
Display current k8s cluster in the title of PowerShell window.

Create a [profile](https://superuser.com/a/1045659) file for your shell under `%UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsÂ­PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

Copy following code to `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
```sh
 function prompt_k8s {
     $k8s_current_context = (kubectl config current-context) | Out-String
     if($?) {
         return $k8s_current_context
     }else {
         return "No K8S contenxt found"
     }
 }

 $host.ui.rawui.WindowTitle = prompt_k8s
```

If you want to switch to different cluster, you can set `KUBECONFIG` to new value, and re-run the file `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
