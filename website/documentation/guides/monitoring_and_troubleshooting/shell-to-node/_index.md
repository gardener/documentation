# Get a Shell to a Kubernetes Node 

To troubleshoot certain problems in a Kubernetes cluster, operators need access to the host of the Kubernetes node to troubleshoot 
problems. This can be required if a node misbehaves or fails to join the cluster in the first place.

With access to the host, it is for instance possible to check the `kubelet` logs and interact with common tools such as `systemctl`and `journalctl`.

The first section of this guide explores options to get a shell to the node of a Gardener Kubernetes cluster. 
The options described in the second section do not rely on Kubernetes capabilities to get shell access to a node and thus can also be used if an instance failed to join the cluster.

This guide only covers how to get access to the host, but does not cover troubleshooting methods.

# Get a Shell to an operational cluster node

The following describes four different approaches to get a shell to an operational Shoot worker node.
As a prerequisite to troubleshooting a Kubernetes node, the node must have joined the cluster successfully and be able to run a pod.
All of the described approaches involve scheduling a pod with root permissions and mounting the root filesystem.

## Gardener Dashboard

**Prerequisite**: the terminal feature is configured for the Gardener dashboard.

Navigate to the cluster overview page and find the `Terminal` in the `Access` tile.

<img style="margin-left:0;width:80%;height:auto;" alt="Access Tile" src="resources/9fb6ca4ff9b7480f93debba833f48590.png"/>
<br>

Select the target Cluster (Garden, Seed / Control Plane, Shoot cluster) depending on the requirements and 
access rights (only certain users have access to the Seed Control Plane).

To open the terminal configuration, click on the top right-hand corner of the screen.

<img style="margin-left:0" alt="Terminal configuration" src="resources/db573582bfc544d294cbde8906a74e07.png"/>
<br>

Set the Terminal Runtime to "Privileged.
Also specify the target node from the drop-down menu.

<img style="margin-left:0;width:50%;height:auto"  alt="Dashboard terminal pod configuration" src="resources/f7b10d48edf44c17ba838ff5c429e39d.png"/>
<br>

The dashboard then schedules a pod and opens a shell session to the node.

To get access to common binaries installed on the host, prefix the command with `chroot /hostroot`. 
Note that the path depends on where the root path is mounted in the container.
In the default image used by the Dashboard, it is under `/hostroot`.

<img style="margin-left:0"  alt="Dashboard terminal pod configuration" src="resources/3da659e9cc4744a2ad3e1c6a50d39c04.png"/>
<br>

## gardenctl shell

**Prerequisite**: `kubectl` and [gardenctl are available and configured](https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl).

First, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.

```
$ gardenctl target garden <target-garden>
```

Target an available Shoot by name. 
This sets up the context and configures the `kubeconfig` file of the Shoot cluster.
Subsequent commands will execute in this context.
```
$ gardenctl target shoot <target-shoot>
```

Get the nodes of the Shoot cluster.
```
$ gardenctl kubectl get nodes 
```

Pick a node name from the list above and get a root shell access to it.
```
$ gardenctl shell <target-node>
```

## Gardener Ops Toolbelt

**Prerequisite**: `kubectl` is available.

The [Gardener ops-toolbelt](https://github.com/gardener/ops-toolbelt) can be used as a convenient way to deploy a root pod to a node.
The pod uses an image that is bundled with a bunch of useful [troubleshooting tools](https://github.com/gardener/ops-toolbelt/tree/master/dockerfile-configs).
This is also the same image that is used by default when using the Gardener Dashboard terminal feature as described in the [previous section](#gardener-dashboard).

The easiest way to use the [Gardener ops-toolbelt](https://github.com/gardener/ops-toolbelt) is to execute 
the [`ops-pod` script](https://github.com/gardener/ops-toolbelt/blob/master/hacks/ops-pod) in the `hacks` folder.
To get root shell access to a node, execute the aforementioned script by supplying the target node name as an argument:

```
$ <path-to-ops-toolbelt-repo>/hacks/ops-pod <target-node>
```

## Custom root pod

Alternatively, a pod can be [assigned](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/) to a target node and a shell can 
be opened via [standard Kubernetes means](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/get-shell-running-container/). 
To enable root access to the node, the pod specification requires proper `securityContext` and `volume` properties.

For instance you can use the following pod manifest, after changing <target-node-name> with the name of the node you want this pod attached to:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privileged-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: <target-node-name>
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    stdin: true
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: host-root-volume
      mountPath: /host
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: host-root-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /
  hostNetwork: true
  hostPID: true
  restartPolicy: Never
```

# SSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster

This section explores two options that can be used to get SSH access to a node that failed to join the cluster.
As it is not possible to schedule a pod on the node, the Kubernetes-based methods explored so far cannot be used in this scenario.

Additionally, Gardener typically provisions worker instances in a private subnet of the VPC, hence - there is no public IP address that could be used for direct SSH access.

For this scenario, cloud providers typically have extensive documentation (e.g [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html) & [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance) 
and in [some cases tooling support](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-advanced#vpn)). 
However, these approaches are mostly cloud provider specific, require interaction via their CLI and API or sometimes 
the installation of a [cloud provider specific agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html) one the node.

Alternatively, `gardenctl` can be used providing a cloud provider agnostic and out-of-the-box support to get ssh access to an instance in a private subnet. 
Currently `gardenctl` supports AWS, GCP, Openstack, Azure and Alibaba Cloud.

## Identifying the problematic instance
First, the problematic instance has to be identified. 
In Gardener, worker pools can be created in different cloud provider regions, zones and accounts. 

The instance would typically show up as successfully started / running in the cloud provider dashboard or API and it is not immediately obvious which one has a problem. 
Instead, we can use the Gardener API / CRDs to obtain the faulty instance identifier in a cloud-agnostic way.

Gardener uses the [Machine Controller Manager](https://github.com/gardener/machine-controller-manager) to create the Shoot worker nodes. 
For each worker node, the Machine Controller Manager creates a `Machine` CRD in the Shoot namespace in the respective `Seed` cluster. 
Usually the problematic instance can be identified as the respective `Machine` CRD has status `pending`.

The instance / node name can be obtained from the `Machine` `.status` field:

```
$ kubectl get machine <machine-name> -o json | jq -r .status.node
```

This is all the information needed to go ahead and use `gardenctl ssh` to get a shell to the node. 
In addition, the used cloud provider, the specific identifier of the instance and the instance region can be identified from the `Machine` CRD. 

Get the identifier of the instance via:
```
$ kubectl get machine <machine-name> -o json | jq -r .spec.providerID // e.g aws:///eu-north-1/i-069733c435bdb4640
```
The identifier shows that the instance belongs to the cloud provider `aws` with the ec2 instance-id `i-069733c435bdb4640` in region `eu-north-1`.

To get more information about the instance, check out the `MachineClass` (e.g `AWSMachineClass`) that is associated with each `Machine` CRD in the `Shoot` namespace of the `Seed` cluster.
The `AWSMachineClass` contains the machine image ([ami](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)), machine-type, iam information, network-interfaces, subnets, security groups and attached volumes.

Of course, the information can also be used to get the instance with the cloud provider CLI / API.

## gardenctl ssh

Using the node name of the problematic instance, we can use the `gardenctl ssh` command to get SSH access to the cloud provider 
instance via an automatically set up [bastion host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host).
`gardenctl` takes care of spinning up the `bastion` instance, setting up the SSH keys, ports and security groups and opens a root shell on the target instance.
After the SSH session has ended, `gardenctl` deletes the created cloud provider resources.

Use the following commands:

First, target a Garden cluster containing all the Shoot definitions.
```
$ gardenctl target garden <target-garden>
```

Target an available Shoot by name. 
This sets up the context, configures the `kubeconfig` file of the Shoot cluster and downloads the cloud provider credentials.
Subsequent commands will execute in this context.

```
$ gardenctl target shoot <target-shoot>
```

This uses the cloud provider credentials to spin up the bastion and to open a shell on the target instance.
```
$ gardenctl ssh <target-node>
```

## SSH with manually created Bastion on AWS

In case you are not using `gardenctl` or want to control the bastion instance yourself, you can also manually set it up. 
The steps described here are generally the same as [those used by `gardenctl` internally](https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl/blob/10a537942b94234914758c0f6d053dc1cf218ecd/pkg/cmd/ssh_aws.go#L53-L52).
Despite some cloud provider specifics they can be generalized to the following list:
- Open port 22 on the target instance.
- Create an instance / VM in a public subnet (bastion instance needs to have public ip address).  
- Set-up security groups, roles and open port 22 for the bastion instance.

The following diagram shows an overview how the SSH access to the target instance works:

<img style="margin-left:0"  alt="SSH Bastion diagram" src="resources/913441003e5641bc90249bdc07d55656.png"/>
<br>

This guide demonstrates the setup of a bastion on AWS.

**Prerequisites:**
- The `AWS CLI` is set up.
- Obtain target instance-id (see [here](#identifying-the-problematic-instance)).
- Obtain the VPC ID the Shoot resources are created in. This can be found in the `Infrastructure` CRD in the `Shoot` namespace in the `Seed`.
- Make sure that port 22 on the target instance is open (default for Gardener deployed instances).
    - Extract security group via 
    ```
    $ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>
    ```
    - Check for rule that allows inbound connections on port 22: 
    ```
    $ aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids=<security-group-id>
    ```
    - If not available, create the rule with the following comamnd: 
    ```
    $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id>  --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
    ``` 

### Create the Bastion Security Group

- The common name of the security group is `<shoot-name>-bsg`. Create the security group:

  ```
  $ aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name <bastion-security-group-name>  --description ssh-access --vpc-id <VPC-ID>
  ```

- Optionally, create identifying tags for the security group:

  ```
  $ aws ec2 create-tags --resources <bastion-security-group-id> --tags Key=component,Value=<tag>
  ```

- Create permission in the bastion security group that allows ssh access on port 22.

  ```
  $ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <bastion-security-group-id>  --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
  ```

- Create an IAM role for the bastion instance with the name `<shoot-name>-bastions`: 

  ```
  $ aws iam create-role --role-name <shoot-name>-bastions
  ```

  The content should be:

``` json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeRegions"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "*"
        ]
    }
]
}
```

- Create the instance profile with name `<shoot-name>-bastions`:
  ```
  $ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name <name>
  ```

- Add the created role to the instance profile:

  ```
  $ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name <instance-profile-name> --role-name <role-name>
  ```

### Create the bastion instance

Next, in order to be able to `ssh` into the bastion instance, the instance has to be set up with a user with a public ssh key.
Create a user `gardener` that has the same Gardener-generated public ssh key as the target instance.

- First, we need to get the public part of the `Shoot` ssh-key. 
  The ssh-key is stored in a secret in the the project namespace in the Garden cluster. 
  The name is:  `<shoot-name>-ssh-publickey`. 
  Get the key via: 

  ```
  $ kubectl get secret aws-gvisor.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\"id_rsa.pub\"
  ```

- A script handed over as `user-data` to the bastion `ec2` instance, can be used to create the `gardener` user and add the ssh-key.
  For your convenience, you can use the following script to generate the `user-data`.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash -eu
saveUserDataFile () {
  ssh_key=$1

cat > gardener-bastion-userdata.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash -eu
id gardener || useradd gardener -mU
mkdir -p /home/gardener/.ssh
echo "$ssh_key" > /home/gardener/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown gardener:gardener /home/gardener/.ssh/authorized_keys
echo "gardener ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >/etc/sudoers.d/99-gardener-user
EOF
}


if [ -p /dev/stdin ]; then
    read -r input
    cat | saveUserDataFile "$input"
else
    pbpaste | saveUserDataFile "$input"
fi
```

- Use the script by handing-over the public ssh-key of the `Shoot` cluster:

  ```
  $ kubectl get secret aws-gvisor.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\"id_rsa.pub\" | ./generate-userdata.sh
  ```

  This generates a file called `gardener-bastion-userdata.sh` in the same directory containing the `user-data`.

- The following information is needed to create the bastion instance:
  
  `bastion-IAM-instance-profile-name`
    - Use the created instance profile with name `<shoot-name>-bastions` 
    
  `image-id`
    - Possible use the same image-id as for the target instance (or any other image). Has cloud provider specific format (AWS: `ami`). 
    
  `ssh-public-key-name`
  
    - This is the ssh key pair already created in the Shoot's cloud provider account by Gardener during the `Infrastructure` CRD reconciliation.
	- The name is usually: `<shoot-name>-ssh-publickey`
	
  `subnet-id`
    - Choose a subnet that is attached to an `Internet Gateway` and `NAT Gateway` (bastion instance must have a public IP).
    - The Gardener created public subnet with the name `<shoot-name>-public-utility-<xy>` can be used. 
    Please check the created subnets with the cloud provider.
    
  `bastion-security-group-id`
    - Use the id of the created bastion security group. 
    
  `file-path-to-userdata`
    - Use the filepath to `user-data` file generated in the previous step. 
    
  - `bastion-instance-name`
    - Optional to tag the instance.
    - Usually `<shoot-name>-bastions`

- Create the bastion instance via:

```
$ ec2 run-instances --iam-instance-profile Name=<bastion-IAM-instance-profile-name> --image-id <image-id>  --count 1 --instance-type t3.nano --key-name <ssh-public-key-name>  --security-group-ids <bastion-security-group-id> --subnet-id <subnet-id> --associate-public-ip-address --user-data <file-path-to-userdata> --tag-specifications ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=<bastion-instance-name>},{Key=component,Value=<mytag>}] ResourceType=volume,Tags=[{Key=component,Value=<mytag>}]"
```
Capture the `instance-id` from the reponse and wait until the `ec2` instance is running and has a public ip address.

## Connecting to the target instance

Save the private key of the ssh-key-pair in a temporary local file for later use.

```
$ umask 077

$ kubectl get secret <shoot-name>.ssh-keypair -o json | jq -r .data.\"id_rsa\" | base64 -d > id_rsa.key
```

Use the private ssh key to ssh into the bastion instance.

```
$ ssh -i <path-to-private-key> gardener@<public-bastion-instance-ip> 
```

If that works, connect from your local terminal to the target instance via the bastion.

```
$ ssh  -i <path-to-private-key> -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -i <private-key> -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no gardener@<public-ip-bastion>" gardener@<private-ip-target-instance> -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

## Cleanup

Do not forget to cleanup the created resources. Otherwise Gardener will eventually fail to delete the Shoot.
