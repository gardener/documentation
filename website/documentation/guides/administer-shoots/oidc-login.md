## Prerequisites

Please read the following background material on [OIDC tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) and [Structured Authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#using-authentication-configuration).

## Overview

Kubernetes on its own doesn’t provide any user management. In other words, users aren’t managed through Kubernetes resources. Whenever you refer to a human user it’s sufficient to use a unique ID, for example, an email address. Nevertheless, Gardener project owners can use an identity provider to authenticate user access for shoot clusters in the following way:

1. [Configure an Identity Provider](#configure-an-identity-provider) using **OpenID Connect** (OIDC).
1. [Configure a local kubectl oidc-login](#configure-a-local-kubectl-oidc-login) to enable `oidc-login`.
1. [Configure the shoot cluster](#configure-the-shoot-cluster) to share details of the OIDC-compliant identity provider with the Kubernetes API Server.
1. [Authorize an authenticated user](#authorize-an-authenticated-user) using role-based access control (RBAC).
1. [Verify the result](#verify-the-result)

> [!NOTE]
> Gardener allows administrators to modify aspects of the control plane setup.
> It gives administrators full control of how the control plane is parameterized.
> While this offers much flexibility, administrators need to ensure that they don’t configure a control plane that goes beyond the service level agreements of the responsible operators team.  


## Configure an Identity Provider

Create a tenant in an OIDC compatible Identity Provider. For simplicity, we use *Auth0*, which has a free plan.

1. In your tenant, create a client application to use authentication with `kubectl`:

   ![Create client application](./images/Create-client-application.png)

1. Provide a *Name*, choose *Native* as application type, and choose *CREATE*.

   ![Choose application type](./images/Choose-application-type.png)

1. In the tab *Settings*, copy the following parameters to a local text file:

    - *Domain*

      Corresponds to the **issuer** in OIDC. It must be an `https`-secured endpoint (Auth0 requires a trailing `/` at the end). For more information, see [Issuer Identifier](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology).
    - *Client ID*
    - *Client Secret*

      ![Basic information](./images/Basic-information.png)

1. Configure the client to have a callback url of `http://localhost:8000`. This callback connects to your local `kubectl oidc-login` plugin:

   ![Configure callback](./images/Configure-callback.png)

1. Save your changes.

1. Verify that `https://<Auth0 Domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration` is reachable.

1. Choose *Users & Roles* \> *Users* \> *CREATE USERS* to create a user with a user and password:

   ![Create user](./images/Create-user.png)

  {{% alert color="info"  title="Note" %}}
  Users must have a *verified* email address.
  {{% /alert %}}

## Configure a Local `kubectl` `oidc-login`

1. Install the `kubectl` plugin [oidc-login](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin). We highly recommend the [krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew) installation tool, which also makes other plugins easily available.

    ```console
    kubectl krew install oidc-login
    ```

    The response looks like this:

    ```console
    Updated the local copy of plugin index.
    Installing plugin: oidc-login
    CAVEATS:
    \
    |  You need to setup the OIDC provider, Kubernetes API server, role binding and kubeconfig.
    |  See https://github.com/int128/kubelogin for more.
    /
    Installed plugin: oidc-login
    ```

1. Prepare a `kubeconfig` for later use:

    ```console
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config-oidc
    ```

1. Modify the configuration of `~/.kube/config-oidc` as follows:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Config

    ...

    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: shoot--project--mycluster
        user: my-oidc
      name: shoot--project--mycluster

    ...

    users:
    - name: my-oidc
      user:
        exec:
          apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
          command: kubectl
          args:
          - oidc-login
          - get-token
          - --oidc-issuer-url=https://<Issuer>/ 
          - --oidc-client-id=<Client ID>
          - --oidc-client-secret=<Client Secret>
          - --oidc-extra-scope=email,offline_access,profile
    ```

To test our OIDC-based authentication, the context `shoot--project--mycluster` of `~/.kube/config-oidc` is used in a later step. For now, continue to use the configuration `~/.kube/config` with administration rights for your cluster.

## Configure the Shoot Cluster

Create a `AuthenticationConfiguration` configmap in the project's namespace.
For more options, check out [Gardener Structured Authentication](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot/shoot_access/#structured-authentication) and [Kubernetes Structured Authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#using-authentication-configuration) documentation.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: authentication-config
  namespace: garden-project
data:
  config.yaml: |
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: AuthenticationConfiguration
    jwt:
    - issuer:
        url: https://<Issuer>/
        audiences:
        - <Client ID>
      claimMappings:
        username:
          claim: 'email'
        prefix: 'unique-issuer-identifier:'
```

Modify the shoot cluster YAML as follows, using the client ID and the domain (as issuer) from the settings of the client application you created in Auth0:

```yaml
kind: Shoot
apiVersion: garden.sapcloud.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: mycluster
  namespace: garden-project
...
spec:
  kubernetes:
    kubeAPIServer:
      structuredAuthentication:
        configMapName: authentication-config
```

This change of the `Shoot` manifest triggers a reconciliation. Once the reconciliation is finished, your OIDC configuration is applied. It **doesn't** invalidate other certificate-based authentication methods. Wait for Gardener to reconcile the change. It can take up to 5 minutes.

## Authorize an Authenticated User

In Auth0, you created a user with a verified email address, `test@test.com` in our example. For simplicity, we authorize a single user identified by this email address with the cluster role `view`:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not forget to add the unique prefix to the name of the user.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: viewer-test
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: unique-issuer-identifier:test@test.com
```

As administrator, apply the cluster role binding in your shoot cluster.

## Verify the Result

1. To step into the shoes of your user, use the prepared `kubeconfig` file `~/.kube/config-oidc`, and switch to the context that uses `oidc-login`:

    ```console
    cd ~/.kube
    export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/config-oidc
    kubectl config use-context `shoot--project--mycluster`
    ```

1. `kubectl` delegates the authentication to plugin `oidc-login` the first time the user uses `kubectl` to contact the API server, for example:

    ```console
    kubectl get all
    ```

    The plugin opens a browser for an interactive authentication session with Auth0, and in parallel serves a local webserver for the configured callback.

1. Enter your login credentials.

    ![Login through identity provider](./images/Login-through-identity-provider.png)

    You should get a successful response from the API server:

    ```
    Opening in existing browser session.
    NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
    service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1   <none>        443/TCP   86m
    ```

{{% alert color="info"  title="Note" %}}
After a successful login, `kubectl` uses a token for authentication so that you don’t have to provide user and password for every new `kubectl` command. How long the token is valid can be configured. If you want to log in again earlier, reset plugin `oidc-login`:

1. Delete directory `~/.kube/cache/oidc-login`.
1. Delete the browser cache.
{{% /alert %}}

1. To see if your user uses the cluster role `view`, do some checks with `kubectl auth can-i`.

    - The response for the following commands should be `no`:

      ```sh
      kubectl auth can-i create clusterrolebindings
      ```

      ```sh
      kubectl auth can-i get secrets
      ```

      ```sh
      kubectl auth can-i describe secrets
      ```

    - The response for the following commands should be `yes`:

      ```sh
      kubectl auth can-i list pods
      ```

      ```sh
      kubectl auth can-i get pods
        ```

If the last step is successful, you’ve configured your cluster to authenticate against an identity provider using OIDC.
