## Overview
The Gardener team takes security seriously, which is why we mandate the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) for Kubernetes as published by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [here](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/). We offer Gardener adopters the opportunity to show compliance with DISA Kubernetes STIG via the compliance checker tool [diki](https://github.com/gardener/diki). The latest release in machine readable format can be found in the [STIGs Document Library](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=container-platform) by searching for Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes Clusters Security Requirements

[DISA Kubernetes STIG version 1 release 11](https://cyber.trackr.live/stig/Kubernetes/1/11) contains 91 rules overall. **Only the following rules, however, apply to you**. Some of them are secure-by-default, so your responsibility is to make sure that they are not changed. For your convenience, the requirements are grouped logically and per role:

## Rules Relevant for Cluster Admins

### Audit Configuration
|ID| Description | Secure By Default | Comments |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|242402|The Kubernetes API Server must have an audit log path set| :x: | It is the user's responsibility to configure an audit extension that meets the requirements of their organization. Depending on the audit extension implementation the audit logs do not always need to be written on the filesystem, i.e. when `--audit-webhook-config-file` is set and logs are sent to an audit backend.|
|242403|Kubernetes API Server must generate audit records that identify what type of event has occurred, identify the source of the event, contain the event results, identify any users, and identify any containers associated with the event| :x: | Users should set an audit policy that meets the requirements of their organization. Please consult the [Shoot Audit Policy documentation](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot_auditpolicy/).|
|242461|Kubernetes API Server audit logs must be enabled| :x: | Users should set an audit policy that meets the requirements of their organization. Please consult the [Shoot Audit Policy documentation](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/shoot_auditpolicy/).|
|242462|The Kubernetes API Server must be set to audit log max size| :x: | It is the user's responsibility to configure an audit extension that meets the requirements of their organization. Depending on the audit extension implementation the audit logs do not always need to be written on the filesystem, i.e. when `--audit-webhook-config-file` is set and logs are sent to an audit backend.|
|242463|The Kubernetes API Server must be set to audit log maximum backup| :x: | It is the user's responsibility to configure an audit extension that meets the requirements of their organization. Depending on the audit extension implementation the audit logs do not always need to be written on the filesystem, i.e. when `--audit-webhook-config-file` is set and logs are sent to an audit backend.|
|242464|The Kubernetes API Server audit log retention must be set| :x: | It is the user's responsibility to configure an audit extension that meets the requirements of their organization. Depending on the audit extension implementation the audit logs do not always need to be written on the filesystem, i.e. when `--audit-webhook-config-file` is set and logs are sent to an audit backend.|
|242465|The Kubernetes API Server audit log path must be set| :x: | It is the user's responsibility to configure an audit extension that meets the requirements of their organization. Depending on the audit extension implementation the audit logs do not always need to be written on the filesystem, i.e. when `--audit-webhook-config-file` is set and logs are sent to an audit backend.|

### End User Workload
|ID| Description | Secure By Default | Comments |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|242395|Kubernetes dashboard must not be enabled|:white_check_mark:| Not installed unless you install it via [kubernetesDashboard](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/api-reference/core/#addon).|
|242414|Kubernetes cluster must use non-privileged host ports for user pods|:x:| Do not use any ports below 1024 for your own workload.|
|242415|Secrets in Kubernetes must not be stored as environment variables|:x:| Always mount secrets as volumes and never as environment variables.|
|242383|User-managed resources must be created in dedicated namespaces|:x:| Create and use your own/dedicated namespaces and never place anything into the default, kube-system, kube-public, or kube-node-lease namespace. The default namespace is never to be used while the other above listed namespaces are only to be used by the Kubernetes provider (here Gardener).|
|242417|Kubernetes must separate user functionality|:x:| While 242383 is about all resources, this rule is specifically about pods. Create and use your own/dedicated namespaces and never place pods into the default, kube-system, kube-public, or kube-node-lease namespace. The default namespace is never to be used while the other above listed namespaces are only to be used by the Kubernetes provider (here Gardener).|
|242437|Kubernetes must have a pod security policy set|:white_check_mark:| Set, but Gardener can only set default pod security policies (PSP) and does so only until v1.24 as with v1.25 PSPs were removed (deprecated since v1.21) and replaced with [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards) (see [this blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future) for more information). Whatever the technology, you are responsible to configure custom-tailured appropriate PSPs respectively use them or PSSs, depending on your own workload and security needs (only you know what a pod should be allowed to do).|
|242442|Kubernetes must remove old components after updated versions have been installed|:x:| While Gardener manages all its components in its system namespaces (automated), you are naturally responsible for your own workload.|
|254800|Kubernetes must have a Pod Security Admission control file configured|:x:| Gardener ensures that the pod security configuration allows system components to be deployed in the kube-system namespace but does not set configurations that can affect user namespaces. It is recommended that users enforce a minimum of [baseline pod security level for their workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/#pod-security-levels) via [PodSecurity admission plugin](https://gardener.cloud/docs/gardener/pod-security/#admission-configuration-for-the-podsecurity-admission-plugin). |
