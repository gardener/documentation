## How can I upgrade my cluster versions?

Upgrading your shoot cluster version can be done manually or by pressing the *Upgrade* button in the Dashboard.

In order to manually update your cluster, you need to change the value of `kubernetes.version` in your shoot spec. Some specifics:

- You must only increment by one minor version (`01.XX.01`) at a time. Supported versions can be found in your garden cluster's cloud profile.
- You can increment by as many patch versions (`01.01.XX`) as you would like at once.
- Once your cluster has been upgraded, you cannot rollback to a previous version.

> [!WARNING]
> Before updating a cluster, you should be aware of the [potential errors this might cause](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot/shoot_kubernetes_versions.md).

The following video will dive into a Kubernetes outage in production that Monzo experienced, its causes and effects, and the architectural and operational lessons learned.

It is therefore recommended to first update your test cluster and validate it before performing changes on a productive environment.

## Can Kubernetes upgrade automatically?

There is no automatic migration of major/minor versions of Kubernetes. You need to [update your clusters manually](#how-can-i-upgrade-my-cluster-versions) or press the *Upgrade* button in the Dashboard.
