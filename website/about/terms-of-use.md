# Terms of Use

_Effective: 26. July 2022_

These website terms of use are applicable to all [linuxfoundation.eu](https://linuxfoundation.eu) and project websites.

## Introduction

The purposes of Linux Foundation Europe ("LF Europe") are to:

* support the collaborative development, availability and adoption of open source
software, hardware and networking and other technologies and the collaborative
development, availability and adoption of open protocols and standards (individually and
collectively, "Open Technology");
* host various projects pursuing the development of Open Technology and other technical
assets, materials and processes (each such project, which itself may include any
number of projects, a "Project");
* provide enablement and support to Projects to assist their development activities; and
* undertake such other lawful activity as permitted by law and as consistent with the
mission, purpose and tax status of LF Europe.

LF Europe is a Belgian private stichting headquartered in Belgium.
These terms of use apply to your use of the websites of LF Project and the Projects.
Any Project may have additional terms and conditions that apply to your use of such websites.

By using the websites of LF Europe or any site of any Project, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.
Users cannot:

* violate anyone’s intellectual property and post anyone else’s copyrighted or confidential
material you don’t have permission to use.
* post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc. or anything that constitutes a
violation of the Code of Conduct of LF Europe.
* post spam.
* abuse the system using metalinks and tags to boost any site’s SEO.
* post just to sell something.
* launch into personal attacks. You’re not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling
will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
* use foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact,
your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.

LF Europe and its websites provide a framework for discussion and user generated information to expand the knowledge base of information related to the projects of LF Europe.
Please note that articles, as well as any other user content on [linuxfoundation.eu](https://linuxfoundation.eu) (such as blogs, directory content, forums, comments, etc.), do not reflect the views or endorsements of LF Europe, our management services provider, The Linux Foundation, its staff, or their members.
We recognize there may be inaccurate information reflected in this site and that users should understand that something that appears on [linuxfoundation.eu](https://linuxfoundation.eu) does not mean that LF Europe has vetted or endorsed that content.

LF Europe reserves the right to take down anything you post on this site, for these or other reasons.
If you don’t agree to these terms, don’t use this website.
Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from the site’s administrators.
A second violation will result in the removal of your user account.
