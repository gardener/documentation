- 👨‍⚖️ **Decisions:**
  - No major technical decisions were finalized in this session.
  - Agreement to:
    - **Revamp and update the proposal document**, addressing the open questions above.
    - Clearly document assumptions, risks, and guarantees.
    - Hold a **follow-up Technical Steering session in a few weeks** to re-evaluate the updated proposal.
  - _Key Discussion Points & Open Questions_
    - **Failure Handling & Recovery**
      - What additional failure modes exist beyond those documented (e.g., ETCD scale-up failures)?
      - Can we always fall back to **normal CPM**, or are there cases requiring **manual intervention**?
      - Assumption: all failures except those explicitly documented should be **retryable / recoverable**.
      - Gardenlet restart behavior:
        - Current proposal resumes from the failed step.
        - This differs from usual reconciliation semantics (restart from beginning).
        - Question: could this lead to **irrecoverable or inconsistent states**?
    - **ETCD-related Topics**
      - **6-member ETCD risk**:
        - 3 members per seed implies **permanent quorum loss** if seed-to-seed connectivity is lost.
      - **ETCD APIs**:
        - Separate APIs exist for member name prefix vs. externally managed members due to uniqueness constraints.
        - Question: can these be harmonized, or would that increase complexity?
      - **ETCD member removal**:
        - GEP-28 (SHSC) requires this as well.
        - Existing plan: `etcd-druid` removes members via HTTP calls to the backup-restore sidecar.
        - Question: can Live CPM reuse this approach instead of introducing `EtcdOpsTask`?
      - **ETCD exposure**:
        - Proposal doc is outdated and will be updated to reflect **Istio-based exposure**.
        - Open question: how are `DNSRecord`s constructed in this model?
    - **Networking & Connectivity**
      - Is **seed-to-seed connectivity** guaranteed at all times?
      - VPN setup:
        - Why is an additional VPN seed server configuration needed on the destination seed?
        - Can we deploy directly in the “target” configuration from the start?
    - **Scheduling & Latency Constraints**
      - Scheduler `ConfigMap` distances are **weights**, not necessarily latency in ms.
      - How is the **“distant region” prevention** for LCPM enforced?
      - The proposal should explain how the **180 ms latency threshold** was derived.
    - **Control Plane Components & Coordination**
      - **Lease management**:
        - Can controllers simply be recreated in the destination seed instead of running in both seeds?
        - Would this simplify the implementation / should we change the proposal?
      - **Gardenlet coordination**:
        - Current design uses back-and-forth updates via `.status.liveMigration`.
        - Question: would **conditions** be a clearer and more robust coordination mechanism?
      - **Gardenlet versions**:
        - How is it enforced that gardenlets in both seeds run the **same version**?
        - What happens if a gardenlet upgrade occurs while a migration is already in progress?
    - **Autoscaling & Resource Management**
      - **VPA recommendations**:
        - Not yet considered.
        - Open question: do `VPACheckpoint`s need to be transferred as part of migration?
