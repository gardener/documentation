#### No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉

- 🪓 [OPERATOR] All the functionality related to the deprecated field `.spec.secretRef` in `Seed`s has been removed and subsequently `.spec.secretRef` will be dropped from the `Seed` API in a later release of Gardener. Please check your `Seed`s and remove any usage before upgrading to this Gardener version. [#8833](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8833)
- ✨ [OPERATOR] The `gardener-resource-manager` deployment procedure was improved. Earlier, GRM was unnecessarily rolled during shoot reconciliation if worker nodes contained custom taints. [#8835](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8835)

#### No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉

- 🪓 [USER] A validation rule was added that forbids changing the primary DNS provider in `.spec.dns.providers` as soon as the `Shoot` was scheduled. [#8761](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8761)
- 🪓 [OPERATOR] ⚠️ The deprecated fields `spec.settings.dependencyWatchdog.endpoint` and `spec.settings.dependencyWatchdog.probe` have been removed from the `Seed` API. Please check your `Seed`s and remove any usage before upgrading to this Gardener version. [#8747](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8747)
- 🐛 [OPERATOR] During the restore phase of control plane migration, the `machine-controller-manager` is deployed with `0` replicas if it did not exist before or if it existed and was not scaled up yet. This fixes an issue that could cause the `Shoot`'s nodes to get recreated during control plane migration. [#8742](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8742)
- ✨ [DEVELOPER] Vendoring has been removed from the project, i.e., there is no `vendor` folder anymore. [#8775](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8775)

#### No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉

- 🐛 [OPERATOR] A bug has been fixed which caused `ServiceAccount`s related to garden access secrets for extensions to leak in the seed namespace in the garden cluster after uninstallation of said extensions. [#8697](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8697)
- ✨ [OPERATOR] The `.status.lastOperation` in `core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.Seed` and `operator.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1.Garden` resources is now only updated each `5s` during a reconciliation.

#### No Demo, But Still Worth Celebrating 🎉

- 🐛 [USER] Gardener refined the scope of the problematic webhook matcher for `Endpoints` objects. Earlier, shoot clusters were assigned a constraint reporting a problem with a `failurePolocy: Fail` webhook acting on these objects. Now, only `Endpoints` in the `kube-system` and `default` namespaces are considered for this check. [#8521](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8521)
- ✨ [OPERATOR] The `MachineControllerManagerDeployment` has been promoted to beta and is now enabled by default. Make sure that all registered provider extensions support this feature gate before upgrading to this version of Gardener. [#8526](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8526)
- ✨ [OPERATOR] The `DisableScalingClassesForShoots` feature gates has been promoted to GA (and is now always enabled). [#8526](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8526)

- ✨ [USER] Gardener now reports nodes for which the `checksum/cloud-config-data` hasn't been populated yet. This could point towards an error on the node and that not all Gardener related configuration happened successfully. [#8448](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8448)
- ✨ [OPERATOR] `gardener-operator` now refuses to start if operators attempt to downgrade or skip minor Gardener versions.

- 🔄 [OPERATOR] `gardenlet` no longer reports the `Bootstrapped` condition on `Seed`s. Instead, it now reports the progress in `.status.lastOperation`, similar to how it's done for `Shoot`s. [#8290](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8290)

- 🪓 [OPERATOR] ⚠️ Gardener does no longer support garden, seed, or shoot clusters with Kubernetes versions `< 1.22`. Make sure to upgrade all existing clusters before upgrading to this Gardener version. [#8087](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8087)
- 🐛 [OPERATOR] `gardener-resource-manager`'s `system-components-config` webhook no longer adds the toleration for the `ToBeDeletedByClusterAutoscaler` taint to system components in shoot clusters. The `ToBeDeletedByClusterAutoscaler` taint is maintained by the `cluster-autoscaler`. This was breaking `cluster-autoscaler`'s drain mechanism when scaling down an under-utilized node. It was causing just evicted system components from to be deleted node to be scheduled again on the to be deleted node. [#8172](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8172)

- 🪓 [OPERATOR] The field `.spec.secretRef` in the `Seed` API has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Gardener. [#8064](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8064)
- ✨ [OPERATOR] `gardener-apiserver` now exposes a new `core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.InternalSecret` API, see the [documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/concepts/apiserver.md#internalsecrets) for more information. [#8025](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8025)
- ✨ [DEVELOPER] It is now easier to annotate `Service`s related to extensions serving webhook handlers that must be reached `by kube-apiserver`s running in separate namespaces such that the respective network traffic gets allowed. Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/network_policies.md#webhook-servers) for all information. [...]. [#8076](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/pull/8076)
- ✨ [DEVELOPER] `gardenlet`'s `ControllerInstallation` controller now populates the feature gate of `gardenlet` via the Helm values to extensions when they are getting installed. The information is populated via the `.gardener.gardenlet.featureGates` key. It contains a map whose keys are feature gates names and whose values are booleans (depicting the enablement status).
