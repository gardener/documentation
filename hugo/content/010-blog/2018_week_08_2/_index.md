title: Namespace Scope
type: Blog

**Should I use:**
<ul style="list-style:none">
    <li>‚ùå one namespace per user/developer?</li>
    <li>‚ùå one namespace per team?</li>
    <li>‚ùå one per service type?</li>
    <li>‚ùå one namespace per application type?</li>
    <li>üòÑ <b>one namespace per running instance of your application?</b></li>
</ul>

**Apply the pattern of the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)**
 
All user accounts at all times should run with **as few privileges as possible**, and also 
launch applications with as few privileges as possible. If you share a cluster for 
different user separated by a `namespace`, **all user has access to all `namespaces`** and 
services per default. It can happen that a user **accidentally uses and destroys** the 
`namespace` of a productive application or the `namespace` of another developer.

**Keep in mind: By default namespace does not provide:**
 * Network isolation
 * Access Control
 * Audit Logging on user level
