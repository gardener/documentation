The Kubernetes client command, kubectl, is included and configured to connect to the local Kubernetes server. 
If you have kubectl already installed and pointing to some other environment, such as minikube or a GKE cluster, 
be sure to change context so that kubectl is pointing to docker-for-desktop:
