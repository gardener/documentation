## Problem
Two of the most common problems are specifying the wrong container image or trying to use 
private images without providing registry credentials.

**Note:** There is no observable difference in Pod status between a missing image and incorrect registry permissions. 
In either case, Kubernetes will report an ErrImagePull status for the Pods. For this reason, this article deals with 
both scenarios.

## Example
Let's see an example. We'll create a pod named *fail* referencing a non-existent Docker image:


```sh
kubectl run -i --tty fail --image=tutum/curl:1.123456
```

the command prompt doesn't return and you can press `ctrl+c`


## Error analysis

We can then inspect our Pods and see that we have one Pod with a status of **ErrImagePull** or **ImagePullBackOff**.

```sh
WDFM33957623A:$ (minikube) kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY     STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
client-5b65b6c866-cs4ch   1/1       Running        1          1m
fail-6667d7685d-7v6w8     0/1       ErrImagePull   0          <invalid>
vuejs-578574b75f-5x98z    1/1       Running        0          1d
WDFM33957623A:$ (minikube) 

```

For some additional information, we can `describe` the failing Pod.

```sh 
kubectl describe pod fail-6667d7685d-7v6w8
```


As you can see in the events section, your image can't be pulled

**Why couldn't Kubernetes pull the image?**
There are three primary candidates besides network connectivity issues:
 - The image tag is incorrect
 - The image doesn't exist
 - Kubernetes doesn't have permissions to pull that image

If you don't notice a typo in your image tag, then it's time to test using your local machine. I usually start by 
running **docker pull on my local development machine** with the exact same image tag. In this case, I would 
run `docker pull tutum/curl:1.123456`

If this succeeds, then it probably means that Kubernetes doesn't have correct permissions to pull that image. 

Add the docker registry user/pwd to your cluster

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockersecret --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<password> --docker-email=<email>
```

If the exact image tag fails, then I will test without an explicit image tag - ```docker pull 
tutum/curl``` - which will attempt to pull the latest tag. If this succeeds, then that means 
the originally specified tag doesn't exist. Go to the Docker registry and check which tags are available for this image.

If ```docker pull tutum/curl``` (without an exact tag) fails, then we have a bigger problem - 
that image does not exist at all in our image registry.
