# Hugo learn theme

[Hugo-theme-learn](http://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
 a fast and modern static website 
engine written in Go. Where Hugo is often used for blogs, this multilingual-ready theme is **fully designed 
for documentation**.

This theme is a partial porting of the [Learn theme](http://learn.getgrav.org/) of [Grav](https://getgrav.org/),
 a modern flat-file CMS written in PHP.
